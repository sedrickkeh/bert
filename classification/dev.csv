ISFP,"I feel like the way the cognitive functions work may jus be accurate enough that a lot of people could recognize their own thought process in the descriptions. And at least the MBTI shows 16 possible personality types and they are not limited to only about 4. People should not even look at the description of the types because they are stereotypes and not real people. Two people can have the same type meaning a similar thought process but yet be completely different people because of their upbringing that shaped the way they react and see the world, and also have different interests. Which is how the order of the functions can blend together a little which is why the whole idea that there is a top four cognitive functions you use is.. Questionable. Also, everyone uses all of those eight cognitive functions, some are just more developed and you use more than others. "

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Dora   The way you arrived at INFP seems legit to me    To me it doesn't. If you look at her's type history, you can see, that se was typed as ESFP. Then she decided, that she is ISFP, which is understandable due to minor differences and same functions. Now she thinks, that she is INFP, which is just almost opposite. INFP and ISFP types are very different and they don't share all functions. Maybe she made mistake in the past about thinking, that she had Se, but to me it looks like she doesn't know her base, her cognitive functions, which is bad sign by itself and often leads to wandering in perC and wondering about type a lot. Her SO may see her one way (and possibly be biased in typology, due to lack of knowledge), but only she can see what she truly is. Other people just see, what she expresses, but no one can see very clearly what is happening inside her. Basically, I want her to rethink her decision about extraverted perceiving function, but I don't say, that it's impossible for her to have Ne. Maybe she really did mistake in the past about Se, but one thing should be done. She should decide about her cognition functions and later think, which function is her dominant one (decide about her stack)."

ESTP,"Hey ESTPs! I am having trouble typing my friend, sort of. When he took the test online he got ESTP but I am slightly skeptical yet not skeptical. He does display a lot of the OUTSIDE stereotypical concepts of an ESTP. He can sometimes say things that are pretty blunt and obvious but really this is just a question if he is feeling or thinking. He sometimes appears really upset when he loses something, I could just be looking too deep (that's why I came to question the ultimate realists). He is very adventurous and definitely has that entrepreneur mentality but I sometimes wonder if that is just a face he puts on. His Dad is definitely xSTP so I wonder sometimes if it's just he feels like he has to be like his Dad or just got that influence somehow.  So my real question is, what do a lot of you do when you happen to get upset about something? Do you sulk or anything like that? I know not every ESTP is the same but I am trying to see if there are any trends here. Sorry I didn't give much info, just trying to get some thoughts on how to determine for sure he is an ESTP.

Also, in a strange way, always making yourself responsible for others is actually a form of selfishness, in thinking that you always CAN make a difference. I never thought of it that way until fairly recently, but I realized it really is true, and, as weird of a use of ""selfishness"" that is, it's really changed my perspective on how I deal with 'failing' to change others and/or situations."

I've often imagined Lenore Thomson/Jung etc finding out about this forum and completely flipping out, due to the crap that is spewed on here. You cannot help that, but you can help your own understanding by doing your own research and looking into things and finding knowledgeable people who do not have such biases and exchange dialogue, whether it's openly or privately. It's all a matter of balance when you look at the complete picture. Each of the personality types has something to offer and they all navigate this world differently, it's because of this, that makes the 'world go round.'"

We can present ourselves as warm and inviting, but this is best understood as an Se social performance rather than a natural expression of feeling. The natural direction of their Feeling is inward (Introverted Feeling (Fi)). Fi prompts ESFPs to manage their emotions on a largely independent basis. The sense of emotional independence conferred by Fi may also contribute to their confidence in advising others about how to manage their emotional concerns."

ISFJ,"  -When something, however insignificant, truly infuriates you but you don't want to offend anyone or step on anyone's toes so you don't mention at the scene of the crime. Instead you come home and vent for an extended time to your friend who, like a good friend brings you to your senses and makes you realize how insignificant this matter is.    Interestingly, ENTPs do almost all of these, probably because we're your anima, and have the same functions in reverse. (Ne, Ti, Fe, Si).

I don't need my kids, for instance,  to express their affection for me, for me to feel loved and for me to  love them, and feel that love. An example is that a few weeks ago was my  birthday. None of our children living away from home called or wrote  me. It didn't bother me one whit! Why? Because I know they love me, and I  don't need them to affirm it. I also know that we communicate quite  regularly, and that when they did get in touch with me, they would  mention my birthday (and probably apologize, which I would then tell  them to forget about it). You see, they have lives to live, and things  to do and take care of. I don't care. I don't need some artificial form  of affirmation for me to know how I feel about them, or to know how they  feel about me. On the other hand, my wife is kind of opposite of that.  She needs those little, and rather formal reminders to have a sense of  being loved. "

ISFJ,"How should someone approach you to be friends? (In a case where you know their name and they know you're name already but you haven't really talked much outside of maybe schoolwork/professional work.)    Thanks! I would say if you want to be friends with one of us, just come right out and tell us. I get attached to decent, outgoing people who are good hearted and kind to others. I tend to lean toward one on one close relationships with people where I can talk to them about anything and not feel judged. I like to feel like they can be open with me the same way. People who are silly and want to laugh with me and don't take themselves seriously. Basically,if the person is not an asshole I would try to be friends with them if they approached me in a decent way :)."

INTP,"Really glad today is Sunday and that by the time it crossed my mind, the liquor stores where already closed..."
INTJ,Financial freedom awaits after long hours of perseverance.
ESFP,"Originally Posted by Powerhouse   Well, I can understand you're saying quite well. So, it's more of a generalisation than a definite rule, as it depends from person-to-person?    Yep.  That's true of most things."
INFP,"*Not true in all cases, some boys notice penises instead, i'm pretty sure the behaviour evolves the same way regardless of the subject though.

ISTJ,So much for a very much needed relaxing weekend.  And this week is starting off with a business trip.  Fun.
ENTJ,"Personally,  I'm pretty chill most of time.  Sort of the calm, rational voice in the room.  I don't think other people are defective just because they disagree with me.  I like it when people disagree with me.  It means I am either about to learn something I didn't know, or hadn't considered.  That's a good thing.    "
ESTJ,"I think that the monetary worth of someone would be their current capital added with a scalar multiplied by their potential capital in the future. However, a person's worth to me is completely subjective, and thus a general consensus would be difficult to achieve. I personally think that people are invaluable in a personal sense, replaceable in an industrial sense, and in comparison to others, equal. I sometimes have difficulty empathizing with those who have lost a loved one, because 1) ESTJs just aren't very empathetic, and 2) Many people die every day. It's a fact of life. Move on, even if it's hard."
ENTJ,"6. Depends on your major, I'd suggest you to pick something that will be useful in the future, after all you will spend a lot of time on it and it would be rather ineffective to pick something just to write a masters thesis."
ISFJ,"1) I'm not a huge fan of gifts or big parties or a big deal.  Honestly if at all possible I would just like for them to spend time with me, having a nice meal and a movie or something.  Anything where the focus is on each other.  If that isn't possible, say one or both of you have work or other engagements, then anything that just shows effort.  If she's at home arrange for flowers/chocolates to be sent (or if she has a workplace that would allow that).  I personally don't like my partner to spend too much on me or make a huge deal, it's the thought that counts.  You should find out what your partners love language is (and your own), there are many websites describing each or you can find loads of quizzes online!"

INTP,Mind boggling.  How many of us types are there out there?
ISFP,"No particular reason, it would just be fun, and silly!"
ENTJ,"While many NPDs mistype as NTJs, this does not necessitate all NTJs are narcissists. The key points to identifying a narcissist are envy and lack of empathy. Inferior Fi does not equate to psychopathy. See the empathy thread. We tend to be loyal and reliable if not the most emotional or flattering.  As someone else has pointed out (don't recall which thread), very healthy ENTJs can seem like enneagram type 2s, generally magnanimous, helpful and sympathetic, without even wanting anything in return. (We like improving things, after all, why shouldn't this include emotions, for those with developed Fi?) "

ISFJ,"Sorry if any of my reasons as to why I think I can relate to the ISFJ type might be offensive, or based on stereotypes I'm still learning about the type as I just came to the conclusion that I might have been more of an ISFJ when I was younger, yesterday.    I think that sounds spot on.  I can identify with pretty much everything you have said.  I'd like to think I'm not overly sensitive with criticism, but perhaps that has conditioned me to be a perfectionist (so I don't hear it often anymore.)  I've always been called an overachiever, but that coincides with not wanting to catch flack for imperfect work.  When I do something wrong or behave poorly, I will catch myself and correct it (with apology if necessary) before someone else does."

INTP,"Then, as always, I sat down in the evening and did some research. This time I chose ""OCD and suicide"". Apparently there is a fairly strong correlation between OCD and an increased likelihood of suicide. However, after reading a great many forum posts and health page stats, I decided to go for a walk and think. What a beautiful night to do it, here in the nicer side of Kyoto. I walked up, with my oppressive thoughts and my frightfully low mood, right up to a gorgeous temple area, all lit up, with tourists, locals, and some little Japanese girls performing the sort of Chinese dragon deal (you know, think Chinese new year). It was great. After observing all this, I turned to a little praying area in the temple grounds. I am not a faithful person, but I do see the sense in appreciating what Buddhism has afforded me in terms of self-preservation and hope. Also, Buddhism is an atheist philosophy, so I felt good about putting my hands together in quiet contemplation and appreciation. Anyway, I took all the uncomfortable, frightening, hope-sucking shit in my head and rationalized it in a different way. Something let up in that moment, and I was able to feel some semblance of calm. I realized a few things."
ENFJ,I know I'm not an ENFJ anymore but I needed to rant. Thanks. :)
ISFJ,"I don't mind it. I think that some N-types over-emphasize the differences. I'd rather they be self-typed than otherwise, but I know how misleading the conventional description can be, and attaching connotations without qualifying them leads to mistyping. It is kind of annoying when we're generalized into the same category as people's parents, and when Si is lumped with Se. So some posts imply that since my type is S, we are all about action and the ""real world"". As if we weren't introverts too... Haha, or maybe I do mind after all; I'm not above quibbling. But that's only a very small part of it. Though pre-N forum I attributed most differences in people to circumstances, so it's great to have access to so many perspectives.

It always shocks me when people I vaguely know or have hung out with only a few times (with other people) come up to me and strike up these grandiose conversations with me and I'm still processing the fact that they even know/remembered my name. Is this an ENFP thing?    No. I know alot of people, but I know all of them. I have a sense of their essence, a few defining characteristics that usually come into play during interpersonal relationships."

It's a finely tuned balancing act and takes a lot of self-awareness to notice which way I need to go.  In my younger years I had a hard time recognizing when I needed to stay in due to my fear of being left out of the loop, but I have gotten over that as I have gotten older, ha."

Simply put, you see Ni at work and you see the core of our thoughts, thoughts for the most part that are not censored due to anonymity, in some respects.

We are not introverted thinkers, INTPs are introverted thinkers (Ti), we are extraverted thinkers (Te). It's the tip of the iceberg analogy again, the 10% you see is Te as it is extraverted, the shit below the water, is composed of Ni and Fi, for the most part, blah blah blah."

People love to be ""authentic"", but to have integrity can be a burden--there is an accountability there that makes some people uncomfortable. Mean? maybe. ;-)    Alright so I've discovered that authenticity and integrity are two different things. First let me define integrity. It's simply doing what you say you'll do. And usually there's no conflict between authenticity and integrity until suddenly you're no longer in the mood to do what you say you'll do. An authentic person will go 'Screw it! I'll stay true to my feelings and I'll break my promise.' A person with integrity will go, 'I'll stick to my promise even though the situation has changed/ it costs me more now/ I'm really not into it anymore'. So integrity involves a certain kind of superficiality. Sometimes in order to be true to others, you have to be untrue to yourself.

ESFJ,"What I've realized is that back then I felt sometimes like he should just ""know"" what I mean when I talk about feelings things (because it's SO obvious to me), but the truth is...he just didn't. Sometimes he needed to piece together the facts of the timeline of events before he could get to the emotions. And for me, it's like I just want him to get why I'm so upset and the feelings involved and the rest of it doesn't matter. But now we've found a better way to talk about it. He tries to validate my feelings and I'll try to find ways to make things a little less emotionally charged or directed (he would totally just shut down and not even try to listen if he felt I was directing my emotional anger at him vs just wanting to be understood). He accepts now that there's a ""feeler logic"" and while it doesn't always make sense to him, he know it's real and doesn't try to squash them anymore. And in return, I try to realize that sometimes too many emotions are overwhelming for him and I'll try my best to stay calm and collected and not too stubborn. I focus more on being understood than setting out to ""win."" "

I read so many times that ISFJs have a great memory when it comes to things that are important to them, but if I can't even remember the faces of my friends or important conversations with them, it just makes me wonder. Also: do ISFJs pay a lot attention to their surroundings? Because it often happens that I'm walking through the streets without paying attention to anything at all. That's why I can't remember routes even if I already took them several times. There's this one place, my best friend and I sometimes visit it but I wouldn't be able to find it on my own, despite being there about 10 times already. It's like I'm so absorbed in the conversation (when with friends) or my own thoughts (when I'm alone) that I don't ""see"" anything at all. I really have to force myself to focus in order to notice things. Apart from that ISFJ fits so perfectly. That's the only thing that somewhat bothers me.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ambrosiandwater   I think my boyfriend may be an ISFP, and I was just wondering about a trait and whether or not this is a common thing for ISFPs. If I raise my voice ever so slightly of impatience in a negative sense, he shuts me out and exits the conversation. Do y'all identify with this?    I think it is. My sister has it more than me, though (see my post above). I've learned to cope with it a little, because my ESTP father is very expressive and he's not just brutally honest, but thinks/feels it necessary to exaggerate his negative emotions to make his point clear. Well that's how it comes accross for me at least. I really don't like people raising their voice when addressing me. I don't say it, but usually I wonder why they can't just give their arguments. I'm not going to be more easily convinced of something just because they raise their tone or become angry, on the contrary. Of course, by now, I understand it is just natural that emotions affect someone's speech and people don't just use it to put pressure on you or to create a conflict.

ISFP,"OK ok enough, my real confession is I'm an INFP and I can really relate to you guys. It sucks to read some ISFP types saying they don't ever think someone will love them. Because I have a serious soft spot for ISFP because my ex was one, she was the only girl I ever really loved out of 4 girls. We were two weirdoes against the world that loved each other for it. I fell so hard for her because she was selfless with her love and wore it on her sleeve. He insides were so beautiful when they came out. She could never word how she felt for me so she just told me to listen to a song that explained it. I played the song like 40 times over I loved how deep the lyrics were, this girl really knew how to melt my soul. She was so beautiful on the inside like I wanted to explore her. She had a primal innocence about her like sometimes she could act like a human puppy lol. It's not insulting, its adorable. There were times when she would say deep things and I felt LOVE. And ISFP stole my heart. She eventually just bounced on me lol but I don't regret any second of it because it was the best relationship I ever had. I can't have contact with her tho because she is like my cryotonite. So yea you ISFPs out there that think you can't find love ur probably some poor INFPs cryptonite lol. Just use those powers for good and not evil lol. I freakin love y'all ;^)"
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Arinn   Think of emotionally broken, your friends leave you or you leave your friends. Blank slate, what do? How would ISTJ's feel & does it apply to most?    Eh, I wouldn't use the words emotionally broken, because I'm not. Extroverted feelers might have more trouble with this. ISTJ's let others depend on them at times but it takes a lot more for us to become dependent on others to the point where we would be lost without them. But hey, they're my friends, it would be nice to keep them since I did make them. Especially the friends that I feel like I really click with. The suckiest part about losing my high school friends is that I knew a few of them since fourth grade and we click because we matured together and probably influenced each other in that way. I guess that's an ISTJ trait, you feel like you're a part of something and you want to stay loyal to that group. They were my group of friends and we went through so many grades together. College was the first time that I made a new friend since I was 15, that's how close I was to my friends."

INFP,"Originally Posted by TeeKwug   My NT friends are doing a good job at convincing me that im intellectuallly inferior.  Im pretty tired of it. I like to be seen as intelligent but im afraid my usual subjectivity discourages this view of me.  Also, is it just me or does society tend to strongly discourage introverted feelers?  That sort of bothers me...ugh    I'm lucky that my main NT friend understands that I approach things from a different perspective - she doesn't tolerate people using emotions to excuse stupidity but she understands my mind is a strange, messy place because of my Ne. Also, she has the same understanding as me that human beings are necessarily subjective - we are biased, we are emotional and rational, we are embedded in a social sphere that is complex. Things are not as neatly logical as some NTs like to assume and if they are, they're rarely useful in the real world because the real world is not prone to neat logical solutions. I think that being aware of your subjectivity is actually smarter and less arrogant than assuming you're capable of objectivity (not that you can't be more objective but you have to realize that can never actually achieve true objectivity)."

ESTJ,"The well thought out stereotypes, not the ""they're mean"" or ""they're annoying"" ones, I can see footing in, I truly can, but for me, I recognize these faults in myself and I do make a conscious effort to try and be more understanding, or let others voice their opinion. What I'm most happy about, reading more about my personality type, is that I'm on the right track. I've recognized my faults accurately, and I'm making the right changes to try and understand others better and just be an all around better person. Doesn't mean I'm going to get along with everyone but maybe I'll come across someone one day that'll say; Hey! Good for you ESTJ! Keeping your trap shut for 2 minutes to let someone else voice their idea for this task! ;)"

INFP,"Instead of studying, I feel in need to help my friends while feeling the tears that ""lay"" on my heart. I push my emotions way down, I put my needs away because it seems more right to help others than myself.. "
ISFP,2. Do you have a dark side? What does it look like? Do you gravitate toward darker subject matters on a normal basis? Or is it just when you're angry/upset/sad?

Hence your inner voice thats perceiving everything, and the intuition looking behind the scenes and toward the future. "

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Vitamin   Hellooo ENTJs! I'll be posting this question in some other forums as well, but I'd like to know- what does ""respect"" mean to you and what does it entail?    I think for most people respect implies admiration of a person - holding that person in high regard for a quality he possesses.  This quality can be something assigned by society (the authority of a police officer, a parent, a superior) or something achieved by the individual (being a well-respected journalist, a humanitarian, a philanthropist). "
ESTJ,"My dad (idk what personality type he is, I'm guessing ISF* or IST*) was always getting on me about that. I am perpetually late and I don't do it on purpose. I am so glad I never got fired for tardiness."
INFJ,"Then me thinks... nap afterwards.  Though I stayed up until the wee morning hours, I still woke up in the wee morning hours.  The hell?  This sleep pattern is getting quite annoying and certainly needs to be reversed by Wednesday or work is going to suck. "

Then he calls starting with ""you called?"" and sounds all pissed off but apparently it's just cos he has to go to work at 4 which is probably a lie cos he sounds pissed at me and says he has to go."
ISFP,"And lastly, my side. I want her in my life. She is one of the most beautiful people I have met, and I would love to get back with her. But I don't want to be taken for granted, and neither do I want her love as a favor. I want her to see my importance in her life. And while I know that the best way to do so is it leave her alone, I can't do anything to hurt her voluntarily. "
ISTP,Oh fuck.... I have entered Philosophizing mode and I cannot leave :/
ESTP,I think he doesn't like my answer because I tell him I have never done any of that so I don't know if I like it or not.  I don't think he likes that response.  I told him I need to try that to find out if I like it or not.

INFP,"Yes a poem is a use of the english language through words which you earlier stated was not very good at communicating emotion. Conveying an emotion, does not mean getting across the information that emotion was trying to convey to you. You can make someone feel sad the key to that is can you make them understand why you feel sad. That is where knowing the inns and outs of yourself through rational observation and continued questioning plays a vital role. Anyone can make a sad song, artists can make a song that says I'm sad and this is why.  "
INFP,"In other news, when I'm out I've overheard a couple times small kids talking to their parents about me, sometimes pointing, ""Daddy, that guy looks like a girl!""  So that's cool too."
ESTJ,"On a related note, do you ever experience this same line of thinking with dealing with personal emotions?    I guess I attribute it partially to being an 8 but I don't think I have that big of an outward emotional range. I've got that kind of stuff pretty much on lock... I've cried over patients I've had before but never in front of anyone. When my jimmies do get rustled for whatever reason I'm always able to decipher why pretty quickly. It's rare that I'll have to sit down and go ""good god WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM"". Ne definitely helps supply potential reasoning for why I feel a certain way."
ISTJ,"But looking back to the events of the past 9 months of drama and self-discovery, I really don't feel any sense of dissatisfaction. I do feel bit sad to be saying my good-byes to some third year students who're moving onto bigger things in life. But I feel fulfilled at the same time knowing that I'm on my way to finding my place in life. The last nine months were tumultuous ones. I had many moments of boredom, of emotional confusion, and of loneliness. But I also had many times of introspection and of learning much about myself. I've accepted myself for who I am. I may not fit ideally into society's mold, but I define my identity. I choose my own destiny."

INFJ,I cannot and will not do that. I simply refuse. Deal. With. It.    I always hated that. When people give you that look as though they think they know you and just say 'you should talk more'
ENTP,Now we just need to tie up some introverted Feeling types and force them to ask us questions...

(Another  way I think of it is kind of like when someone is very badly physically  injured, at first the adrenaline cuts out the pain, and then after a  while they suddenly start to feel everything. I think emotions can work  in a similar way, though the term they work that way in is just over a  larger scale). "
ENFJ,If it was something like lying for a surprise or something and there was a lie about where youre going then thatd be fine. But in the case of avoiding something I dont think avoiding things solves problems.

Honestly, she has no idea how much I do.  The reason is that when she phones she never asks me about my life. She just launches into talking about herself. "
ESFJ,I'm an ESFJ and have searched the internet numerous times to trying to find ESFJ forums but to no avail. I'm not usually into forums and stuff but am really interested in Myers Briggs personality typing and speedreading etc. So I guess that's the reason I search for ESFJ forums and joined this cafe. Also I live with my INTP brother who frequently uses INTP forums from which he seems to get a lot of satisfaction from communicating with other INTPs. So that also spurred me to check out this forum business.

ISTP,"Originally Posted by dargj2   I am a master at losing items I had in my hands 10 seconds ago.    Do you actually ""lose"" them or do you simply misplace them?"
ENFJ,Plus they told me to call them back in 6 months ---- so the door wasn't completely shut :P [even though it feels like that's just something everyone would say]. 
ISFJ,"Anf having a nice meal would probably make it more ""perfect"""
ISFP,"I always ask myself questions like... ""If I died... Would anyone ever find my PerC account and read it?.... what would people say at my funeral? ...would any of it be accurate? ...does anyone really know me, at least certain sides of me I hide? ...who would tell my boyfriend? ...how would they all feel about him? ...how could they feel about him? ...would anyone pick this song that I think would be great at a funeral?"""
ESFJ,"I'm ESFJ apparently, and utterly obsessed with MBTI and rarely go out. Wow."
ISTJ,@nosilla  Happy Birthday! I hope everything gets better for you!
ENFP,"Originally Posted by xdollie.   Doesn't bother me, I enjoy talking about sex!    not sure if I enjoy talking about it - but i dont mind talking about it, after all Im a freelance columnist for an asian american male magazine- and most of my topics involves sex. I just look at it more objectively than subjectively."
ISFJ,"I guess that if I'm super interested in somebody, i can get over that and just want to talk to them, but i can't keep that up every day"
ENFJ,"I also completely agree with this. Conflict is necessary and healthy and shouldn't be avoided. Learning how to manage conflict is really difficult, but I needed to learn how to face it."
ISFJ,"So the best motivation is to protect yourself from the unworthy for the sake of the worthy. Or as the Scripture says, ""Don't toss your pearls before the swines!""     Amazing reply. I completely get where you're coming from too - sometimes the best way to help others is to force them to help themselves... it takes two to tango, eh? "
INFP,I've been contemplating my sexuality for six years.
ENFP,Why do you have to convince HER about all of this ? Is she his mom or what ?
ENTJ,"So now get some sort of shell-shock whenever someone asks me to talk about it. I get really shaky and hyperventilate because I think someone is going to accuse me of whinning or tell me to shuttup, or that I'm a bad person."
ESTJ,"David Keirsey (also an INTP, btw, like your husband) studied the Myers Briggs and found several weaknesses.  In particular, he found that Myers-Briggs test is not very accurate in terms of measuring N vs. S.  I would recommend that you take the Keirsey temperament sorter and see if you get the same results as your MB test.  "
ISFP,"Sigh... lately I've been questioning whether I'm really delusional or not, and whether that's delusional of me... Sometimes I feel like I experience normal emotions, those which everyone experiences and that everyone can see it in me except myself, but that I myself make a big deal out of those emotions and I overanalyze them, which makes me kind of alienate myself from others as a result  Just thinking... idk"
ENFP,"(sweet evil smile)    Woah, who said you guys have a high sex drive??? What did he SAY in his post???? lol"
INFP,"I used to consider myself a pretty ""natural"" person. I don't wear makeup often, though I've been using it more often lately. I have tattoos and piercings. I've ""changed"" my body from what it was when I was born. Is that still natural? I don't shave, but I pluck my eyebrows. Now I'm in the process of combing out my dreads because I want to be able to use my hair as a way to express myself by changing the style, colour, accessories."
ENTP,"Originally Posted by IDontThinkSo   Yeah that's what I thought too until I ran into those ENTPs who were  married with an ISFJ, and I was like, wtf.    Well, the ISFJ i am married to cheated on me with an ENTJ (helps explain my bad mood). In fact, here is a serious question that I would like some ENTP opinions on. She is attracted to the security this guy offers. He is 6 years older than me and is established in his career. I am thinking he is probably an Alpha type personality in her work office too."
ENFJ,"Is this why I'm so DARN drawn to INFPs because they like being seduced and I, an ENFJ, likes seducing?  Is this why I think an INFP would cause me to stop these behaviors with others?  "
ESTP,"When you can ""do what you want, when you want, wherever you want, however you want, etc"" because that's how you roll, and it never fails :)"
ESFP,"BTW: Yes, you'll find me even more old, motherly, protective, traditional, conventional and boring if I say this; but please stay away of the drugs. On the long run it will ruin your beautiful mind and body and it seems that your life is fun without them as well. Sorry, but I can't help it. :)    Don't trust drive-by typings.  Especially by someone who attaches way too much to Jungian functions.  There is certainly plenty to be gleaned from ""communication style"" but that can vary greatly based on context and circumstance."
ISTJ,Originally Posted by Yardiff Bey   Why do you not vaccinate?    I wondered this as well but my J got in the way.  /awaits response/
ENFJ,"And a much more significant crush on Jennifer Connelly.    He's goofy, light-hearted, and still very smart. I like that. I want him as my best friend. Or more so, I want the dynamic him and Pam have. It's just so adorable."
INFP,"Originally Posted by Calvaire   I just feel so numb,I haven't felt his numb in a long time. I used to take care of the numbness self-destructivly,I know that isn't the right way but when I feel like this those thoughts creep into my head. I just hate this.Ever since I been here i've been having SUCH a difficult time,so I just got done bawling my eyes out and I'm sure you can tell and now my roomate has tons of people over here,now I feel even worse. God I hate this. I don't want people to know I've been having a hard time..."
ISFJ,"Haha I remember when I nagged him to do the MBTI test and he didn't seem interested, he seemed avoiding the topic of MBTI. when I finally send the link to him, he said he actually done the test and resulted as ISFJ, and he just stay silent. Maybe it's because it feels like he's revealing who he is? Knowing someone's type does feel like showing who you are, isn't it? :)"
ISTP,"The facial hair wasn't working, it had to go. I look younger than my ancient years already."
ENTP,$mySign=$signList.Shuffle().FirstOrDefault()    Haha true.
INFP,so I guess I will have to sabatoge our friendship because you're going to
ENFP,"I'll tell you this right now. It isn't for any cognitive reason that I have poor posture.  Years of wearing a heavy backpack all day, every day...plus being well endowed...it kind of leads to certain back problems.    I think what he meant is that INFPs tend to have a more strict posture and a ENFP tends to have more of a spring/bounce when walking, that's because Fi doms put a sense of judgement first and Ne doms have spontaneity first place. It's not going to be the same with everyone. Both types tend to look around or upwards, though an INFP is actually more likely to floorscan as well from my observations."
ISFP,- You don't have to think about the animal that was killed while chewing.    Now reasons why not be vegan:

INFJ,@warweasel  I remember when I was a little kid I once popped all the keys and put them back on in alphabetical order (because the QWERTY layout made no sense to me) and then I didn't understand why my Dad got so annoyed at me. 
ESTP,Freedom. Other people seem to grow up and let life tie them down. I'm married with kids but I'm still more free than single people I know of different ages. I have a freedom other people don't seem to have and I think it's something other ESTP's have too.
ESFJ,When it's difficult to watch sad or depressing movies because you know that's actually happening in other parts of the world.
ENFJ,"You want to find people who accept you, you should just be yourself, do things that you like and find people with similar interests or who are alike. I really sucked at socialising in highschool, so I can't give you an advice about that, I had friends with whom I went out, played sports (because I love sports), went to see a movie from time to time, focus on having a circle of friends who can truly appreciate you and accept you for who you are, it will make it a lot easier to get support when something like this happens, but it also enriches your life. You will never be lonely. PC is also a good place tofind people who can relate, to learn, to have fun, you'll definitely find many people who will accept you hereand if such people exist here,they definitely exist out there too. "
ISFP,"Anyway I hope you're all doing well, my precious ISFPs...."
ISFJ,"He loves to sing and cook, and is short, so people used to make fun of him for being ""girly"". Then he joined our friend circle and we are pretty open minded, so no one really laughs at him now. Is it possible that he has undeveloped Fe to avoid conflict with the traditional male image, or is he just hiding the Fe from us?"
ENFP,"Also thank you so much for your answers, I know countless questions can sometimes get exhausting for some and do apologize. :)"
INFP,It also reminds me of that scene in American Beauty where this guy talks so profoundly about a plastic bag.  
ESFJ,"Normally, I love to do sports and puzzles. That's the basics for my happiness."
ENTP,"Should I continue this relationship or nah?I may regret asking this..    In my opinion, annoyances only get louder over time!"
ENTP,"I'd have to say neither as the prime factor would probably be 'interesting', or something I need/want. But I'd rather you give me nothing at all than give me something I won't really like just because you're going to feel guilty for not spending X amount for my birthday."
INFP,I keep thinking about it and my eyes keep tearing up. I really want her to be okay.
ISFJ,"This event may have just been the ""the straw that broke the camels back"". We do not walk away that easily so if she did, she felt extremely strong about the issue. She will eventually cool down however, you just need to give her some time. Trust, loyality and consistency is the most important things to us so if you crossed one of those lines, it's a huge problem with us. "
ESTJ,Zombie.    Continuous Te and the force of Fi if I'm correct.
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Zen Lizard   Friendly debate? I'm up for that. I'm also up for someone asking why I think the things I do. It accomplishes two things: it makes me think about putting my thought process into words, and it makes me feel pleased that someone is interested in me enough to give a shit about what I think. I don't mind alternative views being presented, again, as long as it's friendly. Sometimes I get stuck in a rut and I need someone kind to come along and say ""have you considered this might be what's going on?""....because in many cases, I haven't considered the alternate view, and when I do, it makes sense as reasonable alternative.    Yes, those alternative views can be great sometimes.  Generally I like to think that I have considered all possible outcomes and ideas, and when someone brings up one that I hadn't considered its like, ""Whoa!""  Mind blown for a minute while I factor it in to the big picture.  At lot of the times its experiences like that with someone that will pique my curiosity in them and I'll want to ask more questions and try to figure out how they think."
ESFP,"Originally Posted by LuchoIsLurking   Yeah, true. I would much rather explore the world around me, or go do something than contemplate and reflect my feelings/intuition. I guess it's the opposite for cognitive introverts on the same scale.    I think you are ESFP."
ISFJ,"You know your an ISFJ when you write lot of letters to people that you never send... because there are things you need to say and you are trying to find the words, but it is not a simple thing to express because you need to translate a complex set of emotions without confusing the person receiving it.

INFJ,"Fortunately, the night went by quickly... and the three day weekend is upon me.  Huzzah for the glorious weekend!  "
ENFJ,You Frustrate me so much but i just forget all about it every time we talk..
INTJ,"God doesn't exist, only an idiot believes repressed evolutionary tendencies!"
ISFP,"ISFP-related confession here...I was browsing the type sub forums to inject some variety into my PerC experience, and I was feeling a little guilty about being absolutely clueless in terms on sensors (ALL of my friends, even people in my large extended friend groups, are intuitives...except one ESFP I'm not that close to that kind of annoys me, but that's a story for another time) so I wandered in here. My first impression is that you can be a little cheesy (yeah, the awe-inspiring beauty of nature and the universe, whatever, I get it) but you sure like your artistic expression (or just making pretty stuff)."
INTP,"Ne is the one that knows how to teach someone something complex in terms that others will understand, and Ti/Ne teaches understandable material WITHOUT losing any of the definitive meaning. And I like that. I like to go on a freewheeling, random, interesting adventure. It's like turning mental cartwheels and jumping around with infinite energy. The ideas can become almost tangible, almost like cloth material. (Maybe I'm just in an Se mood.) And once the ideas are tangible, they're expressible, but sometimes they're expressible even without becoming tangible. Except that they're not tangible--they're mentally tangible. Except that that's impossible. "
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Ham   Man, you have women throwing themselves at you and you won't date them?!"
ISTJ,"Rave/Rant: Heard that housemate say ""my parents are really strict"" and almost busted out laughing before I caught myself."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by calliope   This isn't really an INTJ-specific question, just something I want to ask those who are more knowledgable of MBTI.  I guess I still don't believe that all functions are equally preferable, and I may be misunderstanding the concept.  My thought is that an extrovert can live an introvert existence for a while if they want to, and the worst they would suffer would be a lot of boredom and maybe some loneliness.  "
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by TwistedMuses   Thing is, I asked some girls if he seems flirty with them and they told me he doesn't seem to be a person to be flirting with everyone. "
ENTP,Finding that post took remarkably less time than I thought it would!
INFJ,Oh well.  Suffer tonight.  The weekend arrives at 0600...
ISTJ,Her:  So where are you going for two days?  A conference?
INTJ,"@bethdeth  said most of it but something to remember is that F isn't really about emotions, it's about values and placing those values above rational/logical thinking. Yes, sometimes these value judgements are expressed with emotion but I've also seen some Ts who can be just as vehement and expressing defending their reasoning judgements. Both traits are desirable when the individual is mature and self-aware."
INTJ,"I'm a shut-down person. When under stress I stay awake at night (when I know I won't be disturbed) and think. I also like to play the piano and think. Sometimes I discuss things with friends, but mostly so that they think I'm human. :)    This is actually really very interesting to me because there was a while that I thought she was INTP then INTJ then back to INTP again.  What makes it better is that my awesome mother is INTP too so we have this 3 way learning thing happening. I think INTPs are way better at picking up nuances and group dynamics as seen with my daughter and mother.  I blunder through it all with the obliviousness of a blind elephant in one sense firmly sticking to my values whilst they (whilst sticking to theirs) are far more subtle...they know when to actually reach for the phone and keep their group ties.  I shut them all off almost as a defiance for them to figure it all out. Of course there are times when I do reach for the phone....I have an ESFP best friend who just wouldn't have me being without her epic battle stallion capabilities to represent me....honestly, get yourself a pet ESFP (they're the best).  "
ISTP,- took muay thai classes at my school during first term and loved it (and will do the  same for the next 3 years);

ISTP,"Not too many episodes either. If memory serves, season 1 is 6 episodes and season 2 is 4 episodes. "
INFP,i didnt see any.  just a bunch of people having a pleasant night out with their friends.    i thought people only went to clubs to get drunk and hook up
INFP,Overall...I'm still starting...still learning...still waking :P
ESFP,"Originally Posted by HamsterSamuri   How do you feel about INTJs? I've only met 2 ESFPs (that I know of) and they were awesome, but very inconsistent with communication. I could never decide whether that was just their personality or if they really didn't like being around  my INTJness.    I like them alot!"
ISFJ,"when ""i did ~~~ last time"" is a valid reason to do the same again"
ESFJ,"PS  Having read many of the posts on this thread about ESFJ--I see that many of the traits I mentioned are also included on several posts about the ESFJ e.g. gossipy, flirtatious, mean, charming, manipulative, lying, prone to exaggeration, etc.!"

ISFJ,"I went outside for about 20 minutes tonight when I heard some small fireworks and the neighbor kids talking. I walked up the street to where the voices were coming from, and only knew 3 of the girls there. I was about a house away when the little girl I know the best started yelling at me, and then I looked and saw this very cute little girl running up to me with her arms up for me to grab her. I picked her up, commented on how sweaty she was, and went to where the other kids were. I wasn't even 100% sure about what this girl's name was before tonight, but it made me happy that she ran up to me smiling and excited to see me, for whatever reason. "
ENFP,"I can't stand onesies... it's so complicated to go to the toilet !! COOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLDDDDDD !!!    True, but they're comfortable, like a second skin, and when I wear one I it's like I'm playing dress up...not to mention I feel kawaii as fuck~"
INTJ,"I would not call what you did teasing to be honest... Annoying more like. We're not doing this to persuade you, you person with things."
ISFJ,My ISFJ wife has been known to do this.  Don't beat yourself up over it. Realize that most people wouldn't have even bothered to be helpful/useful in the first place.
ESTP,Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk    Haha alright. Sorry I thought you were being narky.
ENFJ,"The pain reflects itself into my dreams sometimes, and my dreams indicate that I'm in pain. So since the pain is already there, the dream feels all the more realistic. Hah! Why am I sharing this? I dunno ... it's just that after 8 years of this, it just almost feels 'normal' now .. almost expected. Sometimes, I actually look at myself in my dreams and go ""oh well, here we go again"" and just go through the motions till the dreams are complete."
ISFP,"My family might see the constant criticism helpful in their eyes, but it's just hurtful and I've built walls against them. I wish I could let them in...I wish that really strongly. But I can't because it would be too destructive for me to deal with when they criticize the even more intensely personal things I would have to share."
INFP,"At my job, there's a 14 year old that managed to get a job with me and my buddy there. We're the only three people my job needs to do this job, and we do it well. I trained the other two guys to do everything, so I have seniority. "

INTJ,"More than often such flux of hormones comes with the change of season when body changes and adjusts metabolic rate and nutritional deficits may kick in under new requirement increases. Those shifts then cause hormonal shifts too to prepare body to a different seasonal conditions and same time may increase other instinctual effects like need for company, offspring, chocolate, or other increases of sensitivity.    If you think I'm going to start needing more...people *shudders*, popping out kids, eating meals consisting entirely of chocolate, and bawling at chick flicks...perhaps a trip to the supplement store isn't a bad idea!

ENFJ,"But still, I've spent pretty much the entire month in this hybrid state of confusion, sadness and disbelief. I'll get over it I know, but I don't think that'll happen for at least a month.

You know, I've found that when I'm said I have to do something to take my mind off of it."

ISTJ,"I'll post the cognitive functions for INJFs below. And like I said, you may very well be an INFJ and I am dead wrong, I don't assume to know anybody that well. I was just curious - especially the way you clash with INFJs, which seems weird to me. Ok, I'll shut up now :) Just was wondering!INFJ cognitive functions:Dominant: Introverted intuition (Ni)"
INTP,"And here we come to another idea: It is unfair that person is not able to watch world by all the glasses (metaphor to personalities) and choose one of them. If it really is predetermined, it... it's really not fair! What would world be, if you would be every type, that you're not? That would be like NegaWorld or something, and it may be cool."

INFP,"Why can't I be downstairs enjoying myself? Am I really up here because of the fact that I have nothing to say? Why is it so hard to talk without being self conscious? I hate myself for being lame. I want to leave this sweet place so I can be alone in my room. I suck big donkey dick. I want to be an annoying extrovert,then at least, people would enjoy my presence a bit more. I hate how strangers are better at talking to my girl than I am. To be full of opinions and not care what people think is what  I want to be."
INTJ,I just had a fantastic night's sleep for the first time in about three weeks. I finally organized my library in the order I think is perfect and fell asleep watching 'A Quantum Activist.' Does anyone else find relief from organizing and ordering things?

INFP,"What he does (leaving Western world for peace of nature), is what I believe every INFPon a deep level wishes for: eternal peace at any cost. I know from my own experience the unnoticeable obsession to run from discomfort to peace. Only afterwards, I realize that I was ""gone"" from here now. That kind of peace (not True Peace offcourse) comes with a high price: blindness. Blindness to what truly is, by auto-filter discomfort away and fill the gaps with fantasy."
ENTJ,ENTJs probably seem like the most likely to forgo children for career advancement and practicality. Personally having kids is probably part of the grand scheme of things for me. Any preference?

ESFJ,"She didn't answer truthfully though, she told me she is intj and then infj.. So I told her you are ESFJ and showed her the profile. She agreed with me  ""that sounds more like me""    more likely she answered truthfully, and test was badly phrased/poorly designed."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by BooMonster   Always. But I've learnt to keep my leaps of assumptions to myself; people find it really annoying. Hell, I'm annoyed when other people do it back to me. It's an assumption - it may or may not be true. Even if I usually think I am right :-)    Of course we're right. ;)  Actually, I feel a hell of a let better after I started to learn to trust my instincts, and I usual am right, or in the ballpark, anyway.  I like to say my assumptions out loud, it's kind of like a guessing game, it's fun.  And it usually amuses people, usually."
ENFP,"also, same for INFP?    Well I've never been able to see myself as any sort of S at all. From when I read the description of N, to taking the test, it was clear that I am one so theres never been any question there. And while I do have the tendency to want solitude frequently for someone who claims to be an extrovert, I can only go a day or so before I'm aching for company. If anything my big question was whether I'm really a T rather than an F, but when I compare ENFP and ENTP as well as their order of functions and all that there are a lot of things that go along with being an ENTP that I really don't identify with. Plus I certainly use ""I feel"" instead of ""I think"" much more often, and that seems to be a pretty good indicator."
ENFJ,"One girl in my friendship group always gets overlooked. She always has been. Today in form I told that she should be appreciated more and explained why and she almost cried. She said it was okay that she doesn't get noticed and that she didn't mind, and I told her that that wasn't fair and it needn't be that way. "
ISFP,"As far as dark subject matters. I love anything cathartic and I love aesthetically ""dark"" things like occult imagery and stuff (not exclusively, I like a lot of other things too, but since you asked about dark stuff...) But when I'm sad or angry or upset I gravitate towards comedy and light things to make myself feel better. I love dark subject matters aesthetically, but not when I'm already dealing with dark feelings."

INFJ,"It was awesome having Lacey & my INTJ(?) coworker meet me in the parking lot last night.  (Lacey had union paperwork she had forgotten to give me earlier in the week.)  Told them I was scared when the came outta nowhere (on a night neither works) and started walking toward me.  Told them I felt like I was getting rolled up on, lol.  Then when we were inside... to the questioning looks of others... I said they were my entourage.  Dunno why, but they hung out with me until I had to go to briefing.  I really like those two... "
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Sela   Best advice:  Answer honestly.  If you throw the test to get the job, you may find out that you dislike it, and grow to resent working there.    Well, I didn't totally throw the test.  Some of the questions were like, ""I don't enjoy making small talk"", agree or disagree.  Every single job requires having pretty good people skills, so I wouldn't want to answer a question like that as no.  But none of the questions that I exaggerated a bit on were in areas that would make me hate my job.  I wouldn't misrepresent my qualifications."
INFP,Is it bad that I was supposed to call my best friend 30 minutes ago so I could wake her up and we could go to the beach..but I don't want to yet.... I'm not ready to end my online time?

INTJ,"Easy as pie.    I cannot understand why you guys don't initiate. By asking me to hanging out directly, it helps me to understand that he not just exchanging pleasantries with me & that he just actually wants to hang out. I would feel so awkward if he said 'no' - in that way I feel like I misinterpreted the entire situation. I'd be really embarrassed. Maybe I should remove the 'feeling' aspect of this situation?"
ENFP,"> Should I go with a stereotype joke about INTJs and no feelings here?  I was intrigued, slightly enamored and amused."
INTJ,PS: That was definitely directed at both of you  (seriously though - might actually be the question I'd ask). One religious question from outsiders seems more than enough though.

INFP,"Originally Posted by Graice   People like that are just pathetic horrible people. I didn't realise that kind of racism still even existed. I mean, usually when I see people being racist they usually have a motive (Like thinking foreign workers are stealing their jobs etc) but to be racist towards someone just because of how they look. That's just awful. I would say something, if it's eating you up inside that badly definitely say something to them. Or if they don't listen every time they make a racist remark make a racist remark about them. Maybe then they'll see how stupid it is.    If it was that easy. One vs many is not good. And sometimes it's a cultural thing. Like the Football Worldcup now. Yes you can find soccer uniteresting and stupid but what cha gonna do? Start an argument with every fan in town? Unlikely."
ISFP,It is impossible to pull me out of a mope. Its better when I can drive somewhere and just deal with it alone but that's not always an option.
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by RedOnion   Fascinating! Well it helps to know it is harmless flirting, so that makes things rather clear.    I will say that it's more embarrassing than anything and precludes her being invited to anything vaguely professional or sophisticated. She'll talk about how great she is at particular sexual manouvres, or what porn she likes, that kind of thing. I prefer guys that see sex as an intimate expression, and her behaviour as an immature grab for sexual attention."
INFJ,"And the antibiotics seem to be helping Roran. He's not 100%, but he's definitely feeling better.  I think this illness is a continuation of the illness he had back in... May?  The one I was being dishonest about, as I recall.  He's still got that damned cough, just not as bad.  Wish I knew what the hell was causing that.  Mark said his lungs were clear... and heart was good.  Those are the two things that would cause me immediate concern (and cause coughing, for that matter.).  I dunno.  Wish I did.

INTJ,"And now I'm curious (again) to know how Hemoglobin got banned. I can't stand it when people get banned and I don't know why.  I need to know, man, I need to know...    Once upon a time a group of people who had been banned from PerC went on to form their own forum of infinite darkness and hatred for all things Cafe. Then a group of troublemakers discovered the site of infinite darkness and became scions of the darkness, spreading their taint throughout the land of the Cafe. Among this group one took the lead and became queen of the land of darkness. She was banned for a number of things, but mainly for leading a pointless rebellion against the Cafe because the scions of darkness didn't like the moderators here."
INTP,I have a crush on a girl that's not my girlfriend and I've gotten so  much better than I used to be at faking confidence... and yet I'm still  so terrified of this girl I like. And I think she might know it and I  know confidence is considered attractive by most people (including me).  So in all likelihood she's attracted to confidence. Does it follow that  she's probably turned off by a lack of confidence? Does it follow that  she's turned off by me? I think she's so sweet and so interesting and to  me she looks like a chance for happiness...
ISFP,"I have been restless in mind and body all day and bored to tears, wishing I could do and say something and get involved with and have something to assert myself over, so I took MBTI test... and got ESTP.

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by comicbookmama   Yeah it took me a long time to begin to see past my worldview and acknowledge that there are other worldviews besides mine. Also, to see that other points of view are not weird primarily because they disagree with mine. I think that is how my husband's personality type has helped balance mine. And on the other hand, he says my personality type has helped him understand that emotions are a neccesary part of cognition. (he advises not to call your wife an imature esfj.

I suppose I was still a ""functional fuck up"" since it did not affect my job too heavily, other than constantly feeling terrible, going to work still drunk or high, etc.  But I never got in trouble or caught. Eventually I started getting paranoid and other such psychosis things, and I got over it, and that was that. I learned a lot I suppose. It lasted about 6 months. That was about 4 years ago."

Or because the market changed in ways that management was unable to keep up with. Nothing is certain here, except that there is something interesting there waiting to be found out. The declaration of bankruptcy tells you that there is something to be learned by looking into it further: it suggests all sorts of possibilties for the total process that caused this meager sign to appear.          Originally Posted by Ni  For example, if you read the news blurb about the toaster company going bankrupt, you would refuse to see that as evidence of any interpretation whatsoever. Instead, you would mentally explore conceptual alternatives for what could have produced that news story. Maybe the reporter was lying: maybe he made the whole thing up in order to meet a deadline. Maybe the toaster company declared bankruptcy not because they were in financial trouble but just as a way to get into the news and thereby attract publicity.    Perhaps Ni naturally makes you wary of their ulterior motives and therefore works against any thoughts that the things you don't know about them are ""good"" rather than ""bad""? I know my thought process definitely relates to that Ne example way more than that Ni one."

But yeah, who actually knows how friendship gets started? It's so seemingly random. My best friend and I intimidated each other at first and neither of us envisioned being such good friends, but it just happened. We saw each other every week at a social group and then started doing stuff in small groups together outside of that. Our interactions grew more and more fond / relaxed / easy.

ISFJ,"I mean like I'm doing nothing at work and then all of a sudden four different requests come in at the same time and I'm like WHOA. Hold up, guys... I don't know if I can handle all of that. Then of course I realize I don't have to do it all right this second and everything's fine. "
ENTJ,"If I look at myself, I agree there is a sense of wonder about strongly career orientated people. I have the tendency to want to say slow down, relax, there's more to life than that. In an immature or frustrated person this might grow into jealousy and misrepresenting them, but I don't think it's the most natural process for an INFP. If I feel someone's very different from me, I will want to understand them and learn from them. And with getting older I simply admire their passion more."

INTJ,"I find Tokyo interesting, but I have never heard about Fukushima until the recent days, so I have no desire to go there. I have no interest in going to Libya either, nothing there interests me.    What? Political upheaval of such immense scale is always fascinating. Much more so than any tourist trap. And Fukushima, in the turmoil of nuclear disaster, talk about life experience that you can reminiscent to old age. And you could be of assistance there helping with evacuation efforts and similar. You'd not only be a tourist but a much needed help."

ISFP,"After keeping my emotions sealed pretty tightly for over a decade, I finally managed to connect the Fi-Se functions (was a major pain and required a lot of detours), and have successfully broken the emotional seal without the world exploding or punching anything out of anger (that was a slight issue when I was young).  I even managed to shed some tears at an animal rescue/family reuniting video the other day (took a few minutes of buildup) - which I'm pretty sure is a first.  I think I might've even learned something new, but I'm still iffy on that part."

ESTP,"How do you guys differ yourself from ENTJ? I've been typed as ENTJ. But the more i think about my type, the more i realize even though my thinking process is kind of similar to that of ENTJ, my whole decision-making process is far more ESTP-ish(my life is also more of ESTP than ENTJ). Lol.    If I had a nickel every time someone typed an ESTP as an ENTJ, I would be a rich man. They can look very similar. The way I like to explain it to people unsure about there type, is that ESTPs in many ways are a hybrid between an ENTJ and an ENTP. They have qualities of both, and I know I personally often type as ENTJ on dichotomy tests. So for people trying to decide between those two very different types, I usually put forth ESTP as a possibility. Just food for thought if you've ever also considered ENTP."

ISFP,"Originally Posted by FiguringItAllOutAsAlways   @temporafelicia ~ When I was younger, I used to get painfully angry at my oldest sister, an ISFJ, for saying I was so sweet and trying to make me sit in her lap and cuddle. I wanted her to think I was kind or caring or mature; an admirable equal. But I hated passionately to be thought of as sweet or childish, because I associated it with being patronized. That clings with me still. I've gathered it's common for Fi doms to attach a lot of things to words, some they don't like because they've attributed their own personal definitions. Now I've realized, of course, being kind, caring, mature or admirable is what people can mean when they say sweet, but it still grates on me nearly every time I get called that."
INTP,"Anyways, we can get into a whole debate on the different meanings of being ""messed up,"" but I don't want to delve into that. Aside from being ""messed up,"" I'm also not a risk taker, so I just can't take a chance with someone and hope that he doesn't turn out to be two-faced."

To which I asked her, ""What is this about?"" and she angrily told me how irritated she was that the dishes weren't rinsed out....."

INFP,"A final  thought I'd like to add towards all of this is that, while I hate admitting this, I sometimes try to see whether my being in a certain unfavorable mood that expresses unhappiness somehow affects the people around me in any sort of way, or even so much as hurts them (no, my posts within these forums were not inteded as such... I am referring towards something else) in any sort of fashion, as I for the most part feel as though I'm a pathetic invisible within society whom isn;t worth much of anyones time for one, and so I've tried tos ee if this is truly so at times through secretly wondering if my moments of pain are affecting any person genuinely in any sort of way (my sadness is not an act either, which iI say to prevent any sort of misinterpretation by any of you... what I mean is that I silently wonder if they feel andy guilt or sorrow at all.) Much of that additionall claims of ever having claimed to have felt ""contemptuous envy"" towards other seemignly ""perfect"" people in the past hyave to do with my own frustrations with my actions, mostly ones from the past to be honest, and anger at not having had more of a clearer perspective at that time, but never are the sudden flashes of envy truly srious, but rather just consist of self-deprication and silent brooding that generally leaves my system after a few hours or so."

ISFP,"Since you're an INFJ, perhaps I can share some insights as to why my INFJ best friend is a good fit for me. We both talk about our personal lives and also the deeper stuff (personality types, why people behave a certain way, and other ""why"" questions). We empathise with each other and don't judge each other's flaws. She's my biggest supporter (I think she'd go against the world to support me even if it was my mistake). We tell each other when we're being annoying (e.g. she likes to poke me literally lol) and are just as quick to forgive and forget. She can be as crazy as me when I'm in one of my random/crazy moods. She enjoys my sense of humour and I find it easy/love to make her laugh/cheer her up. She just gets me. She was the first friend to get into my personal space and that took a lot of getting used to. When she liked me (non-romantically :p), she went the extra mile for me without expecting anything in return. I eventually learned to do the same and loved her all the more for that. You INFJs really will go all out for the people you love. Uhhh. I'm not sure if this post helped at all. :x"

I do everything I can to surround it with a kind, warm, loving, helpful, calm presence. Most people would never know what goes on inside me.

ISFP,"I'm actually VERY spacy for a sensor. Actually I'm very spacy for a human! Even my friends that are intuitive types get a little freaked out by it. I have this very strong disdain for the mundane and this habit of going into my head and fantasizing the moment reality begins to get a little boring or when things aren't going the way I want them to. It started few years back when I was sick for a long time and was stuck in the house with nothing to do...I spent most of my time just inside my head thinking/imagining/fantasizing. Then after that it was a really hard habit to break. =/  So yeah obviously when I'm in my head I'm not aware of my surroundings. However, when I'm outside of my head I guess I'm pretty aware of my surroundings...not as much as the ESFPs and the ESTPs in my life though. "
INFP,"There are so many things I have to do and so many obligations I have set for myself (the majority of which is on PerC).

ISTJ,"I feel kind of bad, when it comes to anger, I let my emotions sometimes get the best of me. Especially when the person I'm mad at isn't around. I guess that's pretty un-ISTJ of me. Or maybe it's very ISTJ of me that I no longer have that emotion after the fact. But I have no idea if I'm in the right or in the wrong. I just am getting a little tired of  the kitchen being a free for all. While this roommate was still studying abroad, we didn't use each other's mugs (which only left the matching dishes), didn't share anything that wasn't verbally negotiated, and cleaned up after ourselves. We were pretty irresponsible as it took forever for someone to do the dishes, which has improved. I'm happy about that. But other than that, the kitchen usually looks like a disaster zone. And only one person actually cooks so.. yeah. I mean, I""m not the perfect roommate when it comes to cleansilness, my book from tuesday night is still in the living room and some of my game controllers are strewed around but those don't get stuck on like food. Nor do those things take long to clean up or spread germs. "

The gaslighting started with her family and was then transferred on to me. She was a girl caught in the crossfire probably not knowing what her priorities should have been imo.

ISFP,"I learned that solidly when I was about 17 or 18 years old--or maybe i was younger. I forget now. But my mother pushed me one more time, and I went and did something really stupid--yeah, I was 16. In fact, it is an act of God that I am still alive today, I firmly believe. But after that, I realized that I was letting my mother control and manipulate me. I don't think she was aware of it--this was her biggest weakness. She depended on her children, for them to give her emotional stability, rather than being that emotional rock for us. It was, to be honest, pathetic. I didn't understand that for another 30 years or more, but I _felt_ it. After my fiasco, and realizing I was still alive, I realized that I didn't need to allow her to determine my reaction. To put a single word on it, I forgave her--internally. And to be honest, I've had to return to that multiple times. "

ISTJ,"You can quote all the sources you want. Heck, I don't care if you even quote the Bible. All you did was focus on one area of communication and cite a definition that supports what you're thinking. Not a prudent move at all. It's similar to a mistake I made on my last trial brief when I correctly cited the ""inevitable search"" doctrine. Only problem is my prof smacked me on the ass for talking about something that wasn't even on topic! There's a good reason colleges and graduate schools offer bachelors degrees and masters degrees for communication. You just pointed out one."

INFJ,I was talking to one of my old friends today. We haven't been able to spend much time together since high school when we were together all the time and it's been awhile since we last visited. He was telling me about sitting in the back of his class - and he was very vehement about it being the back - and laughing at the chaos on a particularly hectic day.
ENFJ,It's frustrating having a lot of friends. I don't want them to think I don't care about them.... but it's almost too much to ask of myself to go and hang out with like 10-15 people all one-on-one.     I relate to this also.

Was an enjoyable night, and Im glad i went with my date. While i was dancing everything else was forgotten,"
ESFJ,"About the feeling like sometimes you just feel morally right, I think that's something we all can feel sometimes. I used to think things were much more black and white than I do now. My husband has really helped among other things broaden my view on it. He once dissected in great detail the old ""Golden Rule' that so many kids back in the day were taught about ""treating others the way you'd like to be treated."" At first I was like, well of course. Makes sense. Good rule to live by. But then he was like but what if you're someone who enjoys being cat called because you like the attention and it makes you feel attractive, do you get to just go treat others that way then too even if it may make them uncomfortable? Obviously there are many other examples. The point being, we don't know what's best for others. So our ""moral rightness"" may work for us but may not necessarily be right for anyone else so when we hold this up high and use it as a grounds to fight all scorched earth, it really just weakens our relationships and makes us less open minded. I've also been around a few *STJs who are older and hold on firmly to their ""rightness"" and man, it makes them just look very closed off to the world and embittered. I really don't want to end up that way just so on my deathbed I can say ""Ah ha! I was right! See everyone!""....  What's the point of that? "

ISFJ,"I kind of agree with her though. I have a friend who is a blatant INFP, and she's always typed as INTP/INTJ, because that was the kind of person she /wanted/ to be, not what she was. I typed as an Extravert when I first took it because I wanted to be an Extravert in high school. Having studied more, I know my true self now, and I am such an Introvert and always have been, haha. I don't know you, and I can't say for sure, so just try to be as honest with yourself as possible, and you'll figure it out!"
ISTP,"I can be so dense sometimes. A couple of days ago I was reading a book at work that has the same title as my real first name, and a coworker walked in and asked ""you reading your autobiography?""

ISFJ,"@Virgo yeah I do think everything has its place and ownership of things is neat and tidy, though it does contradict my view of love as an act of sharing. ;) I don't use public restrooms, I use MINE. I don't use people I use ME, I don't let others organize my things I organize MY things. I will give someone all my money but I will not let them ""fix"" my stuff. I fantasize about growing my own food, building my own house, selecting my own furniture, working with people I pick to work with, etc. If someone gets fired and I then work with someone new I wouldn't mind too much because my relationship with people typically doesn't vary and I'll basically treat them the same. Even my best friends I treat the same way - the difference being they know a lot about me so things go smoothly always. If I fight with my best friend I know it's not personal and they know it's not personal... But if I critique a strangers strategy or approach there is a good chance they will take it personally which is both unfortunate and uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of trying to explain how my intentions are not reflective of me personally calling out their mistakes but instead I'm simply sharing my thoughts which happen to be based on intellect and experience and therefore helpful to others if they seek what I seek - growth. So yeah new people are new obstacles to me, not really about territory with people. Though I was with my ex girlfriend but these days I embrace being single since I never have to be paranoid about a partner ever, or feel responsible for the partner too."

I'm sure thats a reason why there are so many INFPs    I do often feel like I can not competently communicate what i mean as fast as the world usually expects me to!

Not sure whether I'm talking to the cold surface or the sensitive inside, so to speak. I don't think she likes it either - I get the feeling that she'd want to feel confident and know exactly what she wants and do it, not be confused or uncertain.    I'm just speculating here and thinking out loud, but it could be a defense towards judgements. What you see on the outside not always reflects what's going on on the inside. And i talk for myself but i find some difficulty in expressing what i'm thinking/feeling in words. Being unsure of how to go on in life may be really unsettling for us. Be open with her about your intentions and your difficulties. Ask her if it's ok if you try an approach and she can hint you if it's 'working' or if she is uncomfortable.

ISFJ,"It's easier on fora than it is in person, isn't it.  :P (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"
ENFJ,you probably still like him. You should just tell him you've been feeling that way
ISFP,Then they talked about the Wall Street and prices on there.
ISFP,"I have something around 3 friends who are INFP and I can tell you I don't get their ways, sometimes, especially with other people. I am the kind of person who believes you have to make great efforts to nurture your friendships. INFP are very direct people and sometimes can get cold with their words, because they won't do something even if it might make someone else happy, if they are tired, for example. They won't do something if they aren't feeling much like it. I'm the kind of friend who will try very hard to make people happy, even though I am tired or I don't feel like doing something. I'll need my time alone to do whatever I want, later. This is also why I need to spend so long by myself."
ISFP,"Originally Posted by taketheveilpluto   Today is my birthday. I invited some people out to dinner via Facebook invites a couple days ago, but I'm a bit bummed that many people are ignoring it . One person said they would be there and then 5 or so maybes. I know it is my own fault for building scrappy friendships and not many of them at that, but it is like I don't know where to start now. People are so hard to get close to. Maybe I'm just unloveable."
INFJ,I am intrigued and I'm happy that I have 500+ pages to go (I don't know how much that is in ounces...)
ISFP,I'm losing mass amounts of sleep. I can't sleep it seems.
ISTJ,"Edit: Hmm most of the nasty ones were INFPs, they did take your post awful personal since you were only looking for insight into your mother's behavior and that you suspect she is an INFP. I don't consider that typism, even if you didn't convey it perfectly. For instance, I believe my mom is an unhealthy ESFJ - doesn't mean I assume all ESFJs act as she does, but advice on how to deal with someone who isn't in a healthy place is what you need, not namecalling :( (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"
ENFP,See Betty and Veronica    I love seeing this little dilemma in you :).  It's fun !
ISFP,"I am so tired of my mother's immaturity, control and emotional abuse. I know it's just because of her own pain, but I can't live as a victim forever out of pity. I have got to get out of this effing house. She's out of control. She will never forgive me I know for leaving, which makes me see the need to get out all the sooner. And what about my relationships with everybody else? Dad? Siblings? She will view it as treachery if they still love me ""over her"" (for yes, she will choose to see it so black and white) even if she insists they stay in contact, all in her martyrdom way."
ESTP,"Also, the 13 year old is very spoiled. She has no set responsibilities to fulfill at home. And even though she gets everything she wants, she'll do things like make a big fuss about certain meals that her family cooks (demanding that other types of food be cooked at once), and then storms off to her room in a rage when her demands are not met. Do you think that giving her some routine responsibilities around the house (like doing the dishes 3 nights a week, or helping to prepare dinner 2 nights a week, etc) will help to alleviate some of her bratty behavior?   "
ISFJ,"Romance for me is like, somebody who is going to do fun exciting things with me that nobody else will. Spending a vacation somewhere is romantic. Learning a new hobby together is romantic."
INTP,"For the first time in a couple weeks, I am absolutely, completely, genuinely.... bored."
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Judson Joist   It's not really a massive divide so much as a tendency for misunderstanding between ""E"" and ""I"" and between ""S"" and ""N"" - particularly between ES and IN.

ENFJ,"I am feeling great! I just got blond streaks, so now I am looking forward to being able to say stupid things and blame it on my hair color!"
ISTJ,"Get your mind out of the gutter.  Clearly the blank is filled in with ""go get drinks?"""
ISFJ,"You're Making things for family and friends (ex: sandwich) IT HAS TO BE PERFECT . But for yourself it doesn't matter. You worry about friends/family when they talk about conflicts at work or school. You cant make someone happy so you feel like a failure.  You say something sarcastic and everyone is really surprised cause you're the ""nice one"". You feel very bad when the person behind you in the grocery store check out has less items."
ISFP,"(I'm not certain of my ISFP-status, though. This might be way different from actual ISFPs)"
INFP,"I am walking from my intuition again. Life started a very long time ago. What the hell am I doing, because it sure isn't living. I am determined, just like you, one. One,  you're flawed, just like me. Why did you push me away for trying to help you, and put yourself down. You deserve just as much as I do, moral standing doesn't fucking help when you're in a life or death situation against a cold heart. "
ESFP,btw sometimes i feel like i'm esfp bc i like a lot of things esfp people stereotypically (?) does. is that strange or nah?    Not surprised
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Punniez   I think the question you meant to ask was ""How do you fix repulsiveness in fellow extroverted classmates?"".    i tell them to go away.  that always works."

ESFP,"Ti; Information doesn't follow a logical reasoning and when it does, how does it so?"
ESTP,"Contradiction between cynicism/sarcasm, vs optimism and inspiring others. A good natured Estp is usually building up others quite alot. Just not in a false or fake way. I think positive Estps look for a silver lining tho, generally anyways. "
ENTJ,"Do you believe that this is as troublesome as religious fanaticism?    No. I think wars are fought for ideology, and you can use anything from religion, to science, economics, or politics to justify discrimination and violence. If anything, many countries are at a crossroads of all of these factors, with Neo-liberal governments using populist scapegoating to win votes. I see it in American politics with Trump wanting to build a wall across the Mexican border, and in European politics with Brexit. "

ENTJ,"@BIGJake111  There is nothing sexy about a life threatening condition, but being realistic, for the average 13 year old her ""progressive"" thinking may be empowering. Whether or not she practices what she preaches, the ones most likely to be influenced by her will be young girls/boys who could benefit from the positive body image. "
ENTJ,I don't surround myself by totally opposite people... its often NTs or SJs.
ENFJ,"Yeah, I'm waiting right now and am kind of ancy and no one is really posting so I'm just reacting to whatever comes up. Sorry. lol."
ISFJ,"- if this applies to some of you, please answer: why is it that  when you dislike someone, you will still add them on all their social  sites? Say hello every night but turn around and tell someone else how  disgusted you are with this person? Is this normal ISFJ behavior?    "
ISTP,"It's amazing that people wonder why quiet people ARE quiet, with so much stupid ass commentary pinging around."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by themartyparade   That's why I didn't say ""all prostitutes"".    Thing is she claims it's a false claim that it would be the ""majority"". I don't know much about this topic however, I only know what she said, so who knows."
ESTP,"It's about fifty-fifty. I'm nicer than about half of the ENTPs I've seen, but not the other half."
ENFP,But I am wondering how other personality types see us. Curious really as to what they like about us.    
ENFP,"I now have a no-prisoners policy. Any spider, anywhere near me, dies."

ENTJ,"There is no such thing as objectivity. Everyone has an ultimate belief that they base everything off of. This ""foundational belief"" can't be ""proved"". Our church's beliefs are based on the Bible. My brother is clearly not acting according to the principles outlined therein."
ESFJ,her through emotional/feeling mayhem. When she hurts? I need 
ISFJ,"I don't have a smart phone. I only visit this forum when at home from my PC. That right there limits my own contribution. Even when I'm spending my free time online here, I may have nothing to say but really want to hear what others are saying."
ISFP,"For me,  with food,  at least,  I'm a weird blend. I enjoy trying hew tastes,  and with a few notable exceptions,  I seldom order the same thing in a restaurant or fast food twice. However,  unless a restaurant comes highly recommended,  I tend to be a bit reluctant to try new restaurants,  especially in new places. I will pore over reviews,  etc. before choosing. That's food.

INFP,"I will no longer be at the mercy of my own mind. I will stop talking to people in my head. I will no longer percieve my self as a victim to this world. I will no longer hide. I will be the awesome, intelligent, lovely, perverted, deep, funny, embracing, talented, honest, conscious, awake, arrogant, humble, good looking, heartbreaking, loyal, poetic, crazy ass skinny white boy that I KNOW for a FACT I AM! .."
ENTP,how has everybody's day been? I know how much you guys love to talk about such trivial and fickle things.
ESTJ,"I love reading, and I tend to prefer fantasy books, perhaps dystopian books as well.    I like both, but will naturally gravitate towards either alt world fiction, historical, or educational (I like books that teach me new skills)."
ENTP,I'll admit I'm truly amazed - you seem to have yourself convinced that the above is the truth! =P

ENTJ,"Many people ask ""how can I tell if an ENTJ likes/loves me?  If you have to ask, (s)he doesn't.  You'll know.

ENTJ,"My ENTJ acquaintance seems to hate all kinds of jokes and everything that isn't concrete and objective. Everything has to be serious always, and if something isn't a fact, it isn't worth talking about at all. It's like he's on a mission to prove everyone wrong, always. For example, if someone says  something among the likes of ""haha, my face looks like a cinnamon bun"" (perhaps they've failed their make up or whatever, it's just an example) he'd say ""no it doesn't, a cinnamon bun is a lot rounder and there's not even anything resembling cinnamon in your face, *goes on describing a cinnamon bun down to its core then explaining why a human face is nothing like it*"". Then, if someone would say ""I didn't mean it literally, I just wanted to make fun of my mistake, take a chill pill"" he'd get mad because one shouldn't say anything at all that isn't exactly like reality. Everything has to be exactly right, which means exactly like reality. No figurative speech allowed whatsoever. Do you guys dislike metaphors, jokes, sarcasm, and so on? Or is it just him having issues? I seriously doubt all ENTJs are like that, but it'd be interesting to see if many of you would agree with him :)    Agree with the other posters.  That doesn't sound ENTJ at all.  Quite the opposite. "
INFP,"It's interesting in those threads where people post up their inspirational quotes, philosophies, and stories. While it may mean the absolute world to them it has next to zero emotional appeal for yourself. Sometimes that in itself reminds me of how completely diverse we all are."

But I finally realised that my MBTI type is never going to fully explain who I am or my values, so I stuck with the one that comes closest to a generalisation. I don't get drained by people (although I kind of hate most people), I'm way more heavy on Ne than Ti, and I tend to focus on things outside of myself the most.    You have to wait until i spent a ridiculous amount of time myself before you can judge me then XD"

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Rhee    OTOH, would faith trump morality? As unlikely as this sounds: if a man habitually engages in petty theft yet fervently believes that Jesus is his Saviour, would he still be a Christian according to the definition of the 'one rule'?    I'm not really sure. I guess it depends, was he a petty theft and than found Christianity? Or did he always believe this (which makes me think he must have gone to church or had a religious parent) and decides to be a thief? Is a thief by choice or did he get caught up in drugs and was forced to steal? I can't really picture someone having this belief and yet being so malicious. There must be something else in addition. It's like this bible verse: ""If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.""        Originally Posted by Rhee   .. Assuming that the person one ends up marrying does turn out to be his/her true love. I guess I'm being too cynical here. Marriage itself does indicate a huge degree of willingness for mutual commitment, after all.    I probably shouldn't have used the term true love. I don't actually believe in soul mates, I do believe that we are destined to be with someone, but it's through many choices besides the people themselves that get us together. When it comes to marriage, I think if one takes it seriously enough (doesn't get married without knowing everything about the person and the commitment) than we can't make a mistake. After that, problems that arise will hopefully be attempted to be fixed. So, I'm thinking that if you wait until marriage, you won't find yourself stuck with the wrong person. That's me being really optimistic though."

At work is about 10-20% work and 80-90% surfing the internet, reading and posting on here (lately), playing computer games, and listening to music. Any time I stay at work after 5 is because I get overtime for it and I'm not ready to go home yet where I'll have responsibilities and people wanting my attention.

It's like, ""Wow, how does what I do for a living say anything about who I am as a person? Don't you have anything else to talk about rather than your job?    What you do for a living could very well indicate something about who you are as a person. A lot of who you are is by the choices you make and what you choose to do and continue to do for a living is certainly a choice you made. And from that one can get if you like it or not. It's just a topic. The topic isn't important, it's the person's ideas, thoughts, feelings, and reactions to the topic that tell you about the person. Maybe they want to make sure you're not someone who defines yourself by your job and they want to see how you answer it. Of course this isn't always the case and may not even be the case the majority of the time, but it's not always not the case.      Originally Posted by antiant  What the fuck do they mean, what's my type? Don't they realize that you cannot accurately describe or define your type and that it doesn't work that way? People are not lists you can check off or a piece of clay you can mold.    But regardless of how futile of a goal it might be to accurately describe or define your type, how you respond to such a question can tell about you. It can tell if you're someone who has put much time or thought into your type. How much you long for someone else. How adept you are at putting your thoughts and feelings into words. Maybe even a barely-coherent description of your type is enough for them to get the idea. They may not even be comparing themselves to your type. Maybe they just want to know more about you and they can get information by what you like in others. Not everyone would do it for this reason, but some might. With the latter, the initial question would probably be just a starting point for the discussion with the hopes of taking it way off topic based on each others' opinions, ideas, and reactions. Do the questions you ask or hope they ask of you have a different hope?      Originally Posted by antiant  Also, as far as my type is concerned, let the chemistry happen or let it flow, why should I stifle and restrict my opportunities by trying to put my type into a box?    From how I see it, focusing on the initial question and taking them at face-value is just as stifling and restricting the opportunities of the conversation and the rest of the date. Letting the chemistry happen would be going along with the questions, viewing them as merely topic-starters who's content only matters long enough for you to say something relevant to, and seeing where it takes you.

Yet, they haven't shown any proof that they do this, they start to mimic you and this mimicking makes you think, ""Oh wow, you're on the same page as me!"" When in all actuality they are not, their just an imposter trying to impress for the benefit of themselves.    But on the other hand, some people are honest. You tell them you like to draw and travel and they say they can't draw but wish they could. Then they want to see more of your drawings. They've never traveled but maybe always wanted to.

I find it hard not to judge this way of looking at emotions but it's the expectation of the many I'm working aginst and in my earlier years I would coward and supress them.

ISFP,"Do you find it easy to see imperfections in people and yet, at the same time, can look beyond that and see their good traits as well? It could be a skill or knowledge, etc. For example, I knew this manager who thrived in office politics and got into a lot of shit because of that. People liked to talk bad about him and I could see that he brought about his own downfall, yes. But despite the fact that he was a backstabber and twisted his words a lot, he was very good with people and could make them like him. Charismatic, I guess. But a lot of the people around me focused on his negatives and usually spoke badly of him. Other ISFPs are also invited to answer this - I'm curious to know if this trait of being 'accepting of flaws' is common among ISFPs.    I generally am very accepting of people unless I feel that they are threatening my privacy or pushing themselves on me. If they're just doing their own thing, I notice their flaws, but they don't bother me as much as they seem to bother other people around me. I think this may be because I desire others to accept me, flaws and all, and while I have a strong internal motivation to improve myself and become the best version of me, I don't want to be chastised or put down because I mess up. I hate that feeling. "

The duration of time experienced by the people on board a ship  traveling at those speeds would differ from the duration experienced by  the people at the point of departure and the destination. Weeks or  months on the ship would be experienced as years or decades by anyone at  the point of departure and destination depending upon the speed and  distance traveled. This wouldn't be very advantageous to anyone not on board the vessel. The situation seems to get worse as the speed and distance increase.

ISTJ,"Background: Until recently, I'd never said hi to blondie or even looked at her while passing by. I think she got the initial impression that I disliked her for not being another Asian girl. In the times a female friend would stop by my table just to chat for a second or study with me, it would be an Asian girl, often times a cute-looking one. But recently, I made an effort to at least smile at her and say ""Hi"" while passing by as I've come to regard it as something people in like class sections do as a matter of courtesy. The first time, she didn't respond. Probably was surprised. Second time, she smiled back rather forcefully, but not before accidentally looking away from me first."
ESTJ,"To add a note to that, not all ESTJs are like that. Some get along great and some don't despite of the ESTJ and the INFP differences. I do think that it was best that you let go of the friendship that isn't progressing or if she isn't understanding or is willing to but this experience shouldn't get you to think about ESTJs in general.

ISFP,"Do you have any particular tactics for staying calm internally with up-close Fe ""working""? "
ISFP,"More directly, I think that ISFJs are like us only oppositely. It's not infrequent, that people think we are a lot alike, but the reality is that we are like mirror images--we like variety, keeping options open, but you prefer routine, and knowing what's coming up. We both care about keeping a cooperative atmosphere, but we do it for the sake of internal peace, and you for the sake of the whole. Those are two of the main differences, and others flow from that."

ESTJ,"Originally Posted by kept81213   Its very easy to hold a grudge against any personality type. I know I for one have. However, it seems like I lot of you have had experiences with an unhealthy ESTJ, which although I am very sorry about that, is no excuse to generalize our type. My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. "

I obviously cannot understand the various kinds of hell you have gone through - at best I probably sound plain whiny to you, nor can I truly understand what you think or how you feel, but what I can say is that even though our life experiences are quite markedly different, I feel as though to an obviously much lesser degree I do understand. I don't know... I can't explain it, but I just feel it."
INFP,"I talked awhile back about how I wanted to go back to therapy, but I'm afraid to talk to her again. I 'stopped' seeing her by never turning up at our next appointment. I know that she knows I'm like this but I feel horrible about doing it. I tend to avoid people who I feel I wronged thus continuing the pattern of behaviour.    I feel the same way sometimes. "
ENTP,"Real answer. People with Phds usually don't set up their own business. Go with London. Not gonnan further explain why cause you already know what you want, just want outside confirmation.

ENTJ,"seeing as that you say you are on the spectrum you are going to have fact that you admittedly struggle with social context working against you when trying to ""manipulate"" people.  Depending on your level of social functionality give you blanket advice may be a bad thing as what you pointed out is that people interpret your behavior a XYZ when it really isn't"
ISFP,8. The second one always. But only if it's only slightly inauthentic. I'm not going to try to fit in if I have to be really inauthentic to do it.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by Mamoru   Are ESTPs and INFJs compatible when it comes to friendships? I only know one ESTP, and I don't talk to him much. He's cool to talk to momentarily; we have similar interests such as cooking, drawing and video games, but we don't click. However my INFJ friend is cool with him and finds him very interesting; they get along very well and talk a lot. He's very chill and laid back, but can be rather insensitive when he's speaking his mind on subject matters.    Speaking from my perspective, I can be friends with just about anyone. Just don't be an asshole. If I say anything insensitive, it's not because I'm trying to be hurtful- I'm just attempting to get the point across. If you tell me that I went over the top, I'll take your comment into consideration and try to be a bit more careful."
INTJ,@lolthevoidlol  is suggesting. Here's what The Green Light Wiki says about each
ENFP,"There is still time to take powerful positions, not necessarily manager - manager."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by slowcoffee   Can I kidnap one of you and keep you as a personal power plant at home? That would cut my monthly expenses greatly.    Sorry, I bite *smirks*"
ISTJ,All this would have to be done rather carefully so it's not too obvious to bystanders.
INFP,I know people might think I probably shouldn't be so optimistic after certain things I've gone through
ISFJ,Originally Posted by Abbigailius   Is anyone else feeling easily overwhelmed?    I guess I could be easily overwhelmed. But I'm good at hiding it (from others and myself  )
ESFP,"EDIT: I have realised what was the reason I even started thinking about this. It seems that I have a huge amount of guilt when it comes to expressing myslef. So, I was unconsciously trying to find a reason for not expressing myslef.    The point of expressing yourself is to be human, to be really alive and not silenced by anyone or anything.  To be free!"
ISFP,I really dislike the whole INFJ's are special rubbish that people throw around. Please stop.    Are you an INFJ. I thought not.
ENFJ,"I know that for now, all this isn't really for the best."
INFP,"Originally Posted by heartturnedtoporcelain   haha, I'm not sure. I would hate to speculate for people in general. I have just noticed that Fi - my investment in the truth, in justice, in equality and other values that I hold dear, can drive me intellectually. Being invested in a topic, however, can colour your perspective - and not necessarily in a good way. I think the key is self awareness when it comes to intellectual and well as personal matters - understand where you're being completely irrational in your beliefs but not dismissing them out of hand as a useless subjective, emotional reaction."
ISFJ,"You miss your friend a lot when the both of you joined different classes, to the extent of writing a sappy note about how much you miss them. And the first two weeks in a new class was unbearable because your friend wasn't there with you."
ENFP,"Some sites also describe Captain America back and forth as between ISTJ, INFJ, and ESFJ... Not conclusive either. But I'd personally say that he's an introvert. Search results for: Captain America - MBTI in Fiction"
ENFJ,"It's been like this all year, like I don't want to push myself at all. The only test I really pushed myself for turned out to be a really unfair piece of fucking bullshit which knocked me straight off the horse I was only so eager to jump back upon. Now.... fuck it. Fucking fuck. Fuck. "
ENTJ,utterly no clue. you could be purple for all I know. just your country of origin doesn't give me nearly enough info to make that call.

ENFP,Just realised you wanted stories.. mostly happens due to my life experience and an ability to relay what I've learnt in life to other people (that's with people who are younger than me generally because I have a lot to do with people who are younger than me).
ESFJ,"When you start working on something, but then realize that probably nobody will appreciate or understand it, so you start over while trying to make it more acceptable."

ISTP,Originally Posted by Era   No wonder you wanted to start doing stunts on your first flight. Typical Se... :-)    HAH caught me!
ISFP,"What I can't stand about reading is that when I read I have such clear visions and see so many shades, all too many threads to keep track of except when I transfer what I am thinking over to what I am also feeling (hard to explain), and I get worked up in the depth I'm feeling, seeing and dealing with there, but I just can't seem to retain wisdom in the way I want to. So I make so many mistakes and learning just becomes pointless to me. I would try repetition but I am too impatient and it almost makes it less memorable."
ENTJ,"oddly enough, despite being an empath and terrible at manipulation and avoiding it more than 95 percent of people probably do, people have called me manipulative and lacking empathy. i think it's because i say things that are incriminating, and because on the rare occasion i stop saying exactly whats on mind, and instead decide to try to influence someone, i'm glaringly bad at it."
INFJ,Ever wonder how many hairs you end up swallowing in a life time?
ENTP,And in favour of provocative topics.  Such as...  Podcasts and TV shows!?
INTJ,"And since everyone says to let it rest and be patient, that's what I'm going to do. Despite what I've said thus far, I can drop the matter if I want/have to; I'm not very Fe inclined by nature, and I won't be illogically stubborn with an issue if it bothers others."
ISTP,I have a friend who's socially retarded and doesn't know it.
INTP,"Sorry, I thought this was the *random* thread :P The only rule Eris respects is the Rule of Funny. But you might remember Mel Brooks' definition of comedy: ""Tragedy is me getting a hangnail. Comedy is you falling down an open manhole and dying."""
ISFP,"You mentioned that certain people close to you can affect you more easily. Do you think it's more XXFJ types? I find that FJ types can make me growl the most whereas with FP/TP types, I still can keep myself in check. I think it could be because FJs are more emotionally involved (when they are advising you, for example) so that's why it comes off as more strong. Like you said, it's the way they say it and also if something is not tactfully said, I can take it personally. My FJ mother would usually say something like, ""Don't be so naive. If you don't do xxx and end up regretting, then you'll know that you should've taken my advice"" while my TP/FP dad/sis would give advice along the lines of, ""This is my advice bla bla bla - I've already told you the pros and cons/shared with you what I know. The decision is up to you. It's your life."" You know how ISFPs like to be feel free. :D "

ESFP,We are working on getting full custody and can't really do much about the father right now.  The problem here however is with the ESFP grandmother who wants to spend every second with her grandson when her daughter has him.  The daughter is ISFJ by the way.  When asked to please go home after 3 hours so she can have time with her own son... her mother rages at her and calls her selfish and a bad mom.  While her mother is there and hoarding all of her time with the boy... she criticizes every attempt by her daughter to be a parent and do the right thing when the boy misbehaves.  Instead her mother dismisses and ignores the behavior and then indulges him and gives him whatever he was throwing a fit about.

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by KC   It's looking pretty much like Mass Effect 3 out here.    I like this analogy, not because I'm a fangirl, but because ME3 has dissapointed me in the sense that they set themselves a huge workload, ran out of time and then wound up having to just half-ass some of their ideas out. It still just feels like they had to cut a shitload of stuff out which overall made the finished product feel a bit empty (not completed it yet btw). "
ISFJ,You know you're an ISFJ when sometimes people who are kind of far-out fashionably (or maybe even a transgender person) are cool to you but you still worry if what others think and there's tension within yourself that hasn't happened externally in the group...but thoughts are probably occurring in certain peoples' heads.  
ENTJ,"Huge problem for me with professional emails, as I am terse and specific. I have to actively think ""ok, how might someone read this the wrong way and think I am an asshole"" as I have been told by customers, colleagues, bosses, etc, that until they met me in person and saw that I am not a prick, they felt that my emails were harsh. So I have to really work at being careful with my words as this could be my first an only interaction with that person. Esp if the person isn't from MA and doesn't function in a world of pure snark.    I just use an excessive amount of emoticons and hope people don't think I'm a crazed lunatic. That probably won't work once I lose my youthful charm though."

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Einstein   Yeah that can be really difficult. I've gone through a similar thing and my life is still a mess because of it. You always overthink what people will think about your actions and how you affect them, because it's who you are, but sometimes it drains you so much you have no more energy to interact with people and nothing left to give. And you don't want to burden people with it so you spend more and more time alone which makes it even worse. It feels like there's no longer any purpose to life and you're just wasting space being helpful to no one. No one knows you anymore because you've kept to much from them. The worst part is you can be completely lost and miserable while everyone in your life thinks you're fine. At least that's what it was like for me. *hugs*    Thanks. That is a big part of it. :] A lot of it happened when I was stuck in a heavy conflict environment for months. I knew I needed to get out of there, but I didn't know where to go. I had put my OCD on hold because I considered it to be manageable, and when all of this happened it got a lot worse. A lot of my fears and obsessions turned to thoughts of public humiliation and my compulsions to feeling like I had to tell people when I did anything that could have possibly put them in danger."

ESTJ,"It is not a bad thing, because in your group you have the understanding of each other, and you're the majority among personality types so you're considered normal by your peers. They won't see you as stereotypes but you will see stereotypes in us. There was once a psychology study done that proved everyone thinks in stereotypes about something. I try to free myself from stereotyping anyone and only seek to tell you the truth and that is you will never be able to perceive yourself like how we perceive you."

If I do talk about a show I will state the weirdly specific reason I love it and just trust if it appeals they will watch it, or if they are conveniently in my house I will put the DVD on. "
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by jeb   I have lots of questions.  I guess I'll first ask about something I read in the ISFJ descriptions and then saw a bit of when lurking your forum.  It seems as though validation or expressed appreciation is something that ISFJs need.  If that is something that you can relate to  - do you think you need it from everyone, or from specific people?  How do you want people to go about expressing these things to you?  Do you offer the same in return to the people you need it from?    I can only speak for myself: I do need these things. Not on an everyday basis, though. But if someone never makes me feel like I do my ""job"" well (not just in workplace settings, but in relationships and stuff), then I'll start to think that they're not satisfied with me, and then my inferior Ne kicks in and I'm panicking. These validations don't need to be words (for Words of Affirmation is my least used love language), but for example hugs, smiles, small gifts, etc. AND most importantly, lack of criticism. Especially harsh criticism. It might just be my bad childhood memories, but if I'm criticized I go into fight-or-flight mode and my mind just gets screwed up. I'm open to constructive criticism though, if it's done in a smooth and peaceful way, and if the other person seems to be truly interested in helping me overcome my flaws, and not just throwing sh*t at me because they feel like they're entitled to do it. And yeah, of course I treat people the same way."

Like, I'll often push the movies I've seen, or that I want to see, when it's movie night, or I often suggest the restaurants we go to.

As you've stated with having a mediator, in some ways I've had conversations with people (usually much older than myself 50+ years) who ""get me"" and our brains go back and forth and they're able to ""see"" what I'm seeing. It would be interesting to find a mentor, who could steer the things in your head into something that makes much more sense. Having a mind meld is really nice and refreshing, but unfortunately those moments seem to happen with a select and limited few, at least where people is concerned, since Ni isn't really all that popular. Now when we start talking about ideas on the other hand, that's not so unfortunate and it's also why a lot of us love ideas and or concepts more so because it allows us to relate to something that is second nature to us."

ISFP,"(trying to read an isfp here but it seems like he confuses me on purpose...)    Very difficult to stay in that situation.  I'd try.

There are way too many things I need to sort out in life first and I don't need another distraction.I had to revert back to nocturnal status because my brother changed his sleeping pattern back to ""normal"".  It is now the only time I have access to my own laptop and PerC furthermore. I miss sleeping during the night.I miss my ""sick"" voice. It sounds so much deeper and much more charming. More people seem to smile whenever I have that voice.Speaking of voices, someone suggested I should be a voice of Books on Tape because of my reading voice.Once more on voices, I have accidentaly impersonated the following voices: Alec Baldwin, Alan Rickman, Ian McKellen, Brian Griffin.I would like to go out for a 2 hour walk by the lake but severe thunderstorm warnings are deterring me right now.I hate that feeling when threads go in a certain direction to the point that it would feel like I'm intruding in on a conversation that is already happening when I post."

We saw very few cars, didn't know where we were going, and it was awesome. Just a beautiful day enjoying the world around us and spending quality time, which I don't get enough of with my dad anymore. [I mean, I just saw him yesterday for the second time this year, for about 20 minutes when he showed up to give my sister something for her birthday (they share a birthday, and unfortunately my sister missed seeing him by about 20 minutes), and the first time I saw him this year was when he was asking to borrow money from my brother again. He's in a rough place financially, so he's isolating himself for financial reasons partially, but it's hard not to be able to call him unless I want to call him at work, at a prison.] I got home and went to swim with my 10 and 3 year old neighbors to relieve their dad of child watching duties, since I was already gross from water and I love those kids anyway.

I think the main issue is that teachers never explained to us why it was so important and how it would benefit us in the future, so we usually just slacked off, did the bare minimum, and then abandoned our French studies after we hit 10th grade. My Finnish friend, on the other hand, learned how to speak, write, and read in English, Swedish, and a little bit of French. Their education system actually enforces it, whereas ours just lackadaisically parrots to us what's written in their books. "

That's gonna come off as a bit petty and controlling to me, and it's likely going to make me more uncomfortable hanging out with them, and possibly even make me kind of want to avoid them. I think the problem is that being jealous of one person who, in this scenario, is clearly one of my closest friends, is just not going to endear someone to me. I've also experienced this situation as the person who someone was jealous of (that is, I was spending more time with our mutual friend than she was), and it was obnoxious and tiring. It's not my responsibility to put you first or be closest to you out of all my friends all of the time, unless we are dating. "

INTP,"For instance - favorite color? Are we talking about favorite to wear, favorite to look at, favorite to decorate with, favorite plant/flower colors...? They're all different. I don't have a favorite author or movie either.    Ha!  That reminds me of a time when I was standing with the seven-year old daughter of a friend on rocks by the ocean and she asked me innocently what my favorite color was.  I responded crisply, ""To wear, to eat or to look at?""  She screwed up her face and said, ""To look at.""  After I gave her my choice, I said, ""And which is your favorite color?""  She snapped right back, ""To wear, to eat or to look at?""  Funny kid."

Be aware of that and fix it. I'd guess you're 18. I would say younger but you mentioned what I believe is an undergrad major.

ENFP,"I am very slow to trust people, I am terrified of intimacy. In the past, I have opened myself to someone only to have them tell me they did not care, to tell me that they did not feel the same way, and I have a very hard time trusting someone like this. I think that she opened me up, she saw through my pain, through my face, and that really scares me. We went on the date, I liked her a lot. Very talkative, bubbly, interesting. She's athletic, she's attractive, she's sure of herself. I like that a lot. She asked me a lot of questions, some of them were too personal and I told her I did not want to answer and I changed the subject. I would move around the questions, I would ask her questions instead. I told her I was uncomfortable with this and that, and she didn't like that. She told me, afterwards, that I was a different person than I was on Saturday night, that I wasn't as open, and it made her hesitant. I felt awful, I felt like I got rejected, so I brooded a bit and then I called her and left her a message explaining that I am afraid of intimacy, that I am afraid of opening myself. How should I treat this person? Should I be as direct as I would be if I were dealing with myself? How would you ENFP females (or males) see this situation?    I'm not an ENFP, but it sounds like she does want direct honesty. It appears that she recognizes something in you, and truly wants to know the REAL you. That's pretty special and doesn't happen often. So, talk to her. Deeply talk to her, because it sounds like you are wanting to know her too. :)"

It's one of the reasons why you guys are my favorite personality type, and I wish that I could be more like all of you.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by CompassRose   This is so interesting. I was just thinking that this ability to ""read people"" sounds A LOT like what goes on in an INFJ's mind. We are constantly raking in information about our surroundings, especially the emotions of people around us. Except we use this information to empathize with people, and are motivated to collect it because we care about other people's feelings. A little bit different from ESTPs. "

YOUR FEELINGS and willingness to be vulnerable are the best catalyst for forming friendships.

ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Stultum   Yeah, but the other, more reputable sources I found just said 'yeah, there are some Visigothic surnames' as well. Where do you get from that those that have these last names are neccesarily more judgemental and arrogant thanks to the Visigothic influence, even if they actually are (keep in mind, we aren't talking about a few leaders, but about enormous families)? After all, the Visigoths came to Spain many, many generations ago. They have mixed with the 'original' Spanish so thoroughfully... how much does a last name tell you? Two of my sisters married Dutch men, and their Childeren will have Dutch surnames, but there's no doubt that my family is German. Imagine that going on for generations and generations. How strong could the correlation between surname and cruelty (stemming from Visigoth descent, which I doubt, honestly, you still don't give me where that gomes from) possibly be?    I'll amuse you with a couple of examples of messed up Visigoths I knew"

I am glad to see that others have enjoyed and admired what I spoke of if I ever spoke at all. I'm glad to see that others have enjoyed my company and how being myself has brought smiles upon their faces and granted me their admiration. Without comparing myself superficially to others, I am who I am and I wouldn't want any different.

INTP,"Governments can increase or decrease the supply of money through interest rates on short term bonds. I say government, but I really mean the Federal Reserve, which might as well be considered government. They facilitate created money through banks and the Treasury. The money created doesn't necessarily dilute current outstanding money. It depends on what they do with that money. Banks issue debt to business and individuals, but they are only suppose to issue debt to activities that create value, such as starting or improving a business. Housing is also a good uses of debt most of the time, this is one of the rare times it isn't. We can go into why housing is usually a valid reason to raise debt, and why it wasnt this time later. The Treasury uses this newly created money to fiance all government programs, such as national defense. They also take in taxes, and the deficient is the created portion. If the government uses these funds in programs that are valuable to society then they have just created value and the money currently outstanding is not diluted. "

I have very bad memories from that time, and have tried so many times since then to somehow make up for it--but one can't... sigh...

INTP,"Maybe a bit odd, but when I was exercising today I realized that it's perfectly logical that both sexes tend to consider butts as important regions in determining the attractiveness of a member of the opposite sex (something that had always seemed arbitrary to me).

The rest of the time, I'm on Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook, and other social sites. I do like reading things online (like interesting articles about MBTI or news articles), so it's not all social. In terms of message boards, it's not that I don't like them; it's that between all the other stuff I'm doing on the internet, I usually forget about what I posted and never follow through with responding to other people's responses unless I get email reminders about them.

I just turned it into an adventure and kept myself occupied by hiking around the springs (I find it fascinating that the water flows from a hole in the ground despite air temps), throwing snowballs at my German Shepherd, and walking up the lane daily to assess what the odds were that I could get out (on top of my online classes, of course).  I did get someone in a 4WD to pick me up at the barn once and restocked, ate dinner out and got my people fix.  When I've been bogged in study and home-based work in past summers, I've stayed alone at home for up to a week, again using the outdoors, side projects, and my pool for recharges until I had time to get out.

It's like, ""Wow, how does what I do for a living say anything about who I am as a person?    Yeah, that really annoys me too. Unfortunately, I admit that I followed that mould when I was younger, because I was trained to think in terms of job by my family - 'of course doctors, lawyers and accountants are the people you want to associate yourself with naturally'. I was discouraged into doing a lot of things because they weren't useful for jobs. I was actually dissuaded by my dad to take music in high school even though it's probably my favourite pastime above all other things. As it turns out, it didn't really matter, but I started to believe in that shit for a while too - everything I did had to lead me to a career.

Perhaps it would be affected what is expected of us in our consistent social situation/work, rather than our Te or Fi?

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by JennyJukes   It probably depends on which functions are developed in the specific ISFJ - as a teenager who was bullied I overcompensated with my Fe to try deal with it.  Now in my mid 20's I prefer to use my Ti to understand the situation before it gets to the point of abuse, so I guess that's my past experience protecting me from future harm(Si-Ti). So in that case I may come across as more analytical or cold because I need to be to save myself from the pain.  It's also common for ISFJs to take a lot of bullshit and hurt from other people then once that Fe is exhausted, their Ti takes away all the emotions attached to it and then suddenly we seem very cold and that's its come out of nowhere when 95% of the time it has built up.    Could an ISFJ who was isolated or treated badly enough in their childhood theoretically suppress their Fe and maybe appear as something like a Ti-dom? Since they share the same functions, just in different order. Or maybe a better way of putting it would be, could a repressed ISFJ develop their Ti and Ne as a form of escapism from their early trauma?

I scrapped that because it was absolute rubbish, but for a minute I thought that maybe he felt the same way about me. Which is stupid I know, but its my stupid teenage brain.

Be concrete and succinct in informing her why her words are harmful and need to cease.

If we ask for the cause of there being no advance made in such sciences, we find that it is because men do not understand that they should apply themselves to Notions, but make up their minds to adopt these determinations without sense or understanding.He called Isaac Newton a ""barbarian"". lol. Which he was in many respects. How you can be so smart in some areas and so stupid in others. Hegel and Nietzsche are both NFJ commonly mistyped as NTJ. This is total Te and Fi devaluing. What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms -- in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."

ISFP,Originally Posted by Bella2013   I get like that a fair bit.  Have you spent time alone persuing any of your goals today?    *hides* no but I have a good reason. I spent all of last week working towards my goals and then boom in a matter of two days it all came crumbling down. I'm taking a break from life and wallowing in self pity for a bit.
ENTP,Do ENTPs get mad when those around them don't talk to them?
INFP,"You need to have ""mistakes"". Mistakes keep us going, they allow for new ideas to be born, so we can find more passion within ourselves we might not have known was there. And when we successfully travel with belief in ourselves, we achieve the best possible outcome. Epiphany after epiphany, each one proceeding the next all working together intrinsically like a mechanism of that works to give meaning to use then creating purpose and absolving that which will be un-themed on your journey of your mind.

ESTP,"Lets imagine that infj's are oil, more particularly, extra virgin olive oil. Everyone likes you. You provide a lubricant to keep food from sticking.

ISFJ,"No, I do have a craving for multiple loves. My relationship is pretty good. I mean im dating a INTP lol.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by monemi   Actually, probably not that bad. I find communication with EXTJ and ESTP is very good. ENTJ ex's were low conflict and entertaining.

ESFP,"So, emotional independence.  Not to say that we can`t handle them, just that we handle them on our own.    Interesting all this time I thought it was simply Fe I was engaging in social situations. In my experience learning to let Fi users to their emotions has caused me a lot of stress. I see it and hate feeling helpless but everyone must learn to manage their problems independently to some extent. I think I put on this ""hero"" facade (Se) and see it as a reflection of my powerlessness. When you manage your emotions do you allow them to just be or do you try to explain them?"

If my mouth could just find the things to say when I want to say them... My communication skills are so unreliable to me.

Often times we're going to waver back and forth, hot / cold, trying to decide whether or not we want to date someone. And I wanna be clear, it isn't if we like them. It's easy to figure out if we like someone. It's not always easy for us to figure out if we want to date someone we like. And that's where you can get a lot of mixed messages and hot/cold behavior. We can't see how it'll turn out without experience so we're going to do a lot of... push and pull and running away to process our feelings and attempting to start conversations at awkward times because that's when we saw something resembling an opportunity.

Especially those jerks who love to go 'neener neener you have emotions after all' as if I were for some reason pretending I didn't, or who use it as ""proof"" that I really was angry and trying to hurt them (even though I wasn't). Or sometimes I am tired and have a reaction to something that in no way matters, and I don't feel a need to advertise that, since it is silly and rather embarrassing, but that isn't so often as all that."
ESFJ,"Any advice?    I had the same problem in my past relationship.  i went through something traumatic, and I just couldn't get back to the same me.  I am still not the same old me.  When things didn't go according to my plans in my head, I would feel everything was ruined too.  Sometimes I wouldn't tho, because I was trying to make us have a good time.  Those were the best of times, looking back.  I think you just need to focus on the fact that you can make anything fun, no matter how awful it goes.  When the moment happens where it doesn't turn out right, just decide that you can still make this a fun time for your husband.  Believe that you can make it fun, no matter what happens.  Try to be silly and cuddly and realize that those are the things that make spending time together so great. I'm preaching to myself here though, and I often don't follow my own advice, to my own peril.  I have such a hard time relaxing and having fun too.  I don't know if we will ever really overcome this, but we can overcome it sometimes by deciding that we will have fun no matter what happens beforehand, and continuously as things even fall apart."

ISTP,"I still think she's ENFJ.    maybe try a cognitive function test next?  ENFJ's are more emotional than ESTJ's but both can motivate people.  ENFJ's are like life coaches, and they abstract way more than ESTJ's who are more stronger Sensors than abstract.  ENFJ's are charming and can manipulate easily.  ESTJ's are not charming like ENFJ's are.  ESTJ's can seem harsh sometimes when it comes to emotions, but they can be real cool too though, my Dad is ESTJ, he doesn't understand my highly charged emotions, but he loves me and he always wants me to be happy."

ENFP,"Direct is going to be your answer I'm afraid. That's really true of any type I think, when it comes down to miscommunications/misinterpretations.

I'm talking about a long term coping mechanism, rather than a method you use to avoid displaying emotions when it's not appropriate. An example of an emotionally suppressive behavior is making a joke out of everything, so that you can't take anything too seriously, and an example of an emotionally avoidant behavior is habitually ending relationships even though there's nothing really wrong, because you don't want to become attached."

Yea. But isn't that like animal talk? Do we have to reproduce just because it's in our biology? If we acknowledge this habbit, we can choose if we really need to do it. A moose can't do it, he's too stubid to make that decision, hes just going to moose. Besides, doesn't our biology change, it's evolution. If we stop doing some things then we will change.

ENFP,"Originally Posted by Vendetta   Yeah that says alot, it seems to me that you dig into your values and take a very aware decision of the way you treat people and stuff. And helping people would be one of your values rather than the extroverted feeling's ponies and shit. So that's why introverted feelings is egoistical right? Because you don't look for outward feelings but into your own agenda of feelings. Ta-da Thank you that answered my questions :D Except if I'm wrong about something..    I make mistakes, of course, but I love people as much as I hate them. I like to treat them well because I know that most people have suffered some times even more than what I did and that's why they act the way they do. I have this in my morals. Don't do to others what you wouldn't like to be done to yourself. I don't look to fix them or to make their happiness because not I have my own agenda, I'm happy with their happiness.

ENFP,"Let's see, Fi is how something relates to myself and is a subjective function, so I think when Fi is applied to the Ne exploration, it's how I feel about something, however, I know how to be and prefer to be objective because Ne is an objective function, so while Fi has weight on the Ne exploration, finding the answer regardless of how I feel about it can be done (when I apply the thoughts to others). If I'm applying it to myself, Fi plays a much larger role in things. If that makes sense. "

ESTP,Hold up and wait a minute!  Let me get this straight.
ISFP,Originally Posted by Nicoleta   ...I definitely can relate to this:
ENFJ,"I get very frustrated by things I can't do. Right now I'm frustrated because I can't open my water bottle because the lid is on too tight. The reason I can't open it is because I have a neuromuscular disease, wheelchair, weakened muscles, blah blah. Nothing new, but it's it's very frustrating when I'm thirsty and I can literally see the water but I just can't get it open. And I can't ask someone at work to help because that would be far too embarrassing. "
INFJ,"not to bad all things considered, I have my boy cat here next to me with his head resting on my laptop, about to go make dinner, I do feel jumpy,not sure why exactly,maybe because I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and am not looking forward to it,I very much dislike this doctor."
ISFP,I've changed my mind about college but I don't want to tell anyone because I'm afraid they'll think I'm giving up or they'll get mad at me :(

INFP,"Am I an individual with no one else around?  My brain grasps out and connects, becomes one, with what I am doing/experiencing... it's as if I am not there.  Similar with large group dynamics I guess.  So your body is here yet you do not inhabit."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by TeamPB   yea...sense of accomplishment...but if you're an ESTP, then you're technically already mentally fucked up, so I did literally nothing.    There's your problem right there peanut. "
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Ka1serTheRoll   I get awkward early on, but I tend to become more comfortable over time. It's sort of that early-medium stage of interest that's the most awkward for me    Any ideas what would be helpful to help you loosen up?"

INTJ,"In a event setting : we can't bear uncertainty's nagging, and changing directions in the middle of something mess with our carefully crafted plans.    I suppose you know inside how flexible you are -- but we mirror each other there -- inside I may be VERY certain -- but you would not know that from how I act or speak."
ENTP,Originally Posted by confused girl28   How  do  you  deal  with anger?    The same way I deal when I am not angry.
ISFP,"Originally Posted by DLila   Fi is personal therefore completely dependent on how our experiences shape our perception. I can't watch animals being killed not so much because the act is gruesome (I enjoy Tarantino films) but because killing a helpless being brings out strong emotions within me. I don't think its wrong as much as it feels wrong. And because it feels wrong, I will never be able to change my opinion of it. I will never be swayed. Now imagine a lot many values going through the same cycle. The ones that provoke stronger emotions will never change, they are intrinsic to our being. Others like 'if I can get away with lying I probably will- but I won't do it if it may have a negative impact someone else' that's how I justify lying. That's how I justify a lot of things, and thus ""stay"" moral to myself. Thankfully this is where extrovert Sensing and Thinking come in and save us from mad self-indulgence. Because of Se and Te we tend to look for the social understanding of a particular value i.e we can only validate our values (to ourselves) once we understand its universal impact. Thus these values end up more grounded and are more action- oriented, than simply words to defend at social gatherings. That's how I see it, others may experience it differently :)    Thank u for your reply. Yes, I guess I understand it further whereby Fi is more on personal experiences, but as per your answer plus an article describing Fi, it makes sense that my husband loved standing up for the helpless, and yes, he loves very much animals. :)"
ISFP,"I'm sorta straying out of Se. I'm trying to illustrate how Se and Ni work together and how that ends up manifesting in me. Hopefully I've given some measure of a comprehensible image on that front. But in summery: I am constantly aware of thousands of details about my current immediate environment, this awareness gives me good spacial sense and good situational awareness, I enjoy things which are pleasing on a sensory level (soft things, delicious things, musical things [My love of poetry is at least a third the way the words literally feel to speak when they have a flow to them, a third how they sound when they flow together, and maybe a third some of the philosophical meanings]) because of this constant awareness of that level of things, I enjoy exciting experiences because of that, beauty is absolutely wonderful because of that. Ultimately it's just a constant awareness of the moment that I'm in. That awareness is primarily sensory and emotional and secondarily conceptual and logical. "
ISFP,"The link to the actual answers is in that thread as well, but the convo in there actually was more helpful at least it was when I was having it lol"
ENFP,"3) I do get approached a lot - and hit on constantly at bars - I think it is only in part due to my MBTI and part due to a simple visual aesthetic. But ENFPs definitely give off positive vibes - which, of course, attract people to them."
ISFJ,"-you know you're an ISFJ when you get told you worry too much by a friend or family member, and then promptly start worrying about worrying too much (or more accurately, start worrying about them thinking you worry to much)"
ENFP,"I also enjoy other ENFPs because we ENFPs are lots of fun.    Agreed, ENFPs are lots of fun. INFPs or Js are up there too. but ESTJs, I feel is an ENFP's rivalry. could be friends and cool with each other on the outside (bc we love everyone, right?) but there's something there that is, in a sense, competition. cant quite put my finger on it."
INTP,Currently wondering why such a plethora of PerC members seek out the INTP board for validation.
ISFJ,"Perhaps I have met people who show those traits towards a certain group of people (and they themselves are apart of this group) but aren't that way towards others (even if they trust them). So their loyalty is always towards that group and it's basically unbreakable. But that doesn't sound like the way healthy ISFJ's are portrayed (which to me seems like they'd be wiling to help anyone). No one ever seems ISFJ to me, at least where I live."
ENFP,"Or we could always go to Hiddleston and say, ""Hey Tom, we're all curious. The next time you're in Loki character mode could you take the Meyers Briggs test for him. We've got a bet going as to what type he is."""
INTP,"Also, why isn't this 57 page thread stickied when the 25 page INTP fashion thread is stickied?"
INTP,I wonder how it is possible to waste as much time as I have in the past four months and yet still feel like I had so little fun.
INFJ,My inbox is my sacred archive of everything! just the thought of pressing Clear All could lead to a mini heart attack. I often dive into the depths of my inbox and laugh about the emails I exchanged with my friends. So Many Memories.
ENFJ,"I think it's not even an ENFJ weakness as is widely touted. Just as introverts are sometimes condemnes for not wanting human contact, extroverts are condemned for being 'needy'. Yeah well, sometimes human contact really is a need, but that doesn't make us needy."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by FePa   I'm not taking any of them to the altar, for now, I'm happy mauling Thor while Harley is busy    "
ESTP,Is it important to her to achieve? Does she always want to be doing things? 
ESFP,"I know an ESFP and honestly he is a very nice person. For more than once I considered something serious between two of us, but for more than once I considered giving up as well, because you are just confusing!"
ESTJ,How was your life between the age of about... 1 to 12 in general? Where there any specialy instances that seemed Te to you? How was your interaction with other children? How curious were you? How did you complete your tasks and how did you do at school? What were your hobbies and are there any interesting things that you want to mention?
ISTJ,"Not to forget the iffy electrical wiring that sparks everytime certain powerpoints & lisghtswitches are turned on. Continually blown fuses, asbestos backed lino laid ontop of tar backed lino tiles, stairs & suspect walls that are a mystery as to how they ever met buiding code standards.    I have a 1950s house with the original hot water service.  Every now and then the header tank will start to over flow.  My house mate came flying into my room one morning with bulging eyes, scaring the absolute shit out of me.  I rush to the back door with her thinking my dog has died or there are human remains somewhere and she points to the cascade of water down the side of the house. I just walked off and grabbed the ladder to get up to the manhole on the way out to the water mains.  She started gibbering at me and I said...oh shut up.  Next time will you just knock on my door...thanks. "
INFP,Originally Posted by silverhamham   I've needed to get this out for a while.

ESTJ,"Originally Posted by maust   What almost works? The male-female divide?     Yup, sorry I wasn't clear enough. When I think of it, it doesn't really work though. But it does with me and the ENTJ I know best."
ENFJ,"And right now, I'm sitting with my grandmother, whom I haven't seen in over three months due to school and traveling constraints. She has developed dementia after pancreatic cancer and can't remember a lot. It's heartbreaking to have her keep apologizing for her memory problems because she's in her early 90's. The language barrier also makes things worse and I wish I had kept up with chinese/mandarin. What's hurting me right now is she only remembers her daughter in law, saying she was her favorite and asking me what was I and who was I? Like   "
ENFJ,"2) 1/3 of the time, maybe those people that arent open will wish they had been when they see me opening up, even if i looked like an idiot"
ESFP,Is this just a very inaccurate stereotype or does it vary depending on the person?    The stereotype is what I've bolded. Then it gets over-exaggerated on typology forums. Then it becomes a way for people to tie every girl (or guy) they meet who they see engage in that behavior even out of context as an ESFP and so the stereotype continues to perpetuate itself. 
ENTJ,"My redundant pondering on the subject keeps coming back to ""balance"". I want to find that perfectly balanced space."
ESTP,"Don't be a showoff now...     Nothing much to show off. If I see what I don't like, just pick yourself up and walk away and leave. That's just me."

ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Ashleyshrugged   I'm sure there are plenty of people in this world that don't like me because of my personality type, but in my case I've found the key factor is weather people are F's or T's.  Every single one of my friends is a T.  My husband is an INTP, which actually works out incredibly well.  He sort of needs someone to ""do the things he doesn't like to do"", like planning and cleaning the house, and I really need to have someone who listens to me and gives me great advice, he is great at creating a big picture plan, and I'm good with the details.  Now F's on the other hand, I can barely understand you guys.  It really stinks because 75% of women are F's, so most of my friends are men.  I do have a few girlfriends but many of them just have a hard time with how I will basically tell it like it is and I'm not very concerned with their ""feelings"".  "

Do I really have to try and pick one ;) Well there was one when I was 12, I lost a big favourite collection of something (that kind of collection was quite the fashion back then among kids) while traveling. I went back to the place where I lost it but too late and a bit later I decided to throw myself on the ground in a crowded street to act my frustration out. Lol, I decided after I got up that I didn't want to act out that way again. I thought it was too ridiculous/childish/something plus it was painfully obvious all along that it wasn't helping a bit beyond letting go of my anger. (Afterwards I managed to make up for the lost collection by getting a better one)"

It would be so much easier for me to know how to talk to them and approach them.  "
ISFP,"I met an ISFP girl last summer, and although I hate to use the term, it started as something of a fling. Hitting it off quickly, getting drunk with our friends, making out off on the side somewhere - mutual first kisses (I'd had some before, but considering the circumstances I don't count those).

The basic reason is that a circular cover can not fall through the hole, no matter what angle you insert it in as. Compare that to a hypothetical square manhole cover- which can go through and be lost forever if someone inserted it diagonally. So yeah, people are just being smart in making sure that the covers don't fall through. "
ISFJ,"also, when im just talking with friends, ad am more relaxed, etc, im not always tuned in to how they feel and say something that they arent happy with (i do notice that they arent happy with it pretty quick though, i guess) "
INTP,"If I had a choice between Ni/Te and Ti/Ne, I'd always choose Ti/Ne. And if I wasn't utterly convinced that I'm a Ti dominant, I'd say I was ENTP. Both my Si and Fe are fairly weak, actually. I mean, I'm *fairly* Fe reliable, but when it comes to adapting to others' emotions and expectations, I use Ti more. That's... needless to say... kind of bad... because Ti doesn't work well with the emotions of people who aren't Ti users... As for Si, I think I use past-remembered facts and situations somewhat (occasionally in a chess game, I will use it), and I compare a lot of things to book scenes and quotes. I wouldn't be surprised if I occasionally tested out as ENTP, though, for having a strong Ne. But I'm definitely INTP--all you have to do is present me with a difficult math problem. Course, I use Ne quite a bit there, too... because a lot of the time, I invent new ways to solve the problem... which I teach to other people and the teacher really starts to wonder why everyone's showing work that solves the problem a different way than the one she taught. :P But I use Ti a lot more while learning the first way and how it works... and I can't just know how to do the problem--I have to know why that way works and what ""version"" of the first numbers you're aiming to get."

ISFJ,"I think, also, I've kind of grown in a way to suppress my Fe in many situations. One thing that stands out as possibly being Si-Fe to me is that I have a very good memory as far as remembering others' likes/dislikes and remembering almost every conversation I have with others, even if there was nothing special about a particular conversation. Often times I'll bring up a joke and the person will ask if I made that up or heard it somewhere, and I'll have to remind them they're the one who told me that. Or I'll commonly reference a past conversation only to see the person doesn't remember it at all. Over time I've learned to sort of downplay this, or play dumb as far as remembering things, because I worry it can seem weird to people or that people might think I'm taking a special interest in them or something, when in reality I'm not and it's just the way I naturally think. Also, just not being as nice/friendly to people over time because of possibly being taken advantage of in some way, or with people thinking I have some sort of ulterior motive or something, so I just become a little less Fe-ish around people I don't know well over time.

ISFP,"I just can't deal with this anymore. It's nice that I've given everyone in my family the kind of emotional support they needed at some point, but then have it thrown back in my face by not being there for me or disregarding my opinions and thoughts. I have really low standards for relationships and I no longer feel surprised or hurt when I'm rejected/devalued/ignored partly because of my family. I pretty much expect those things to happen at some point in every relationship, so I no longer really put in the effort into my relationships to get past the ""good friends"" phase. I've never wanted to get into a second romantic relationship (the first was a total disaster and ruined a close friendship of mine), because of those inevitable reasons, and I've grown fiercely independent of others to protect myself. I have friends, and some good friends, but I think they feel closer to me than I do to them because I always appear to be what they want, but deep inside I know I'm not adaquate enough."

Doubting myself is common (it's not supposed to happen to an ENTJ I'm told, but I still doubt my abilities in some things...it's sort of strange when I compare what I've achieved and still think I fall short?). I spoke to an ENTJ friend and his advice was ""Fight. You are a fighter. So keep fighting"". That was really what it took to get me going; in that sense I said ""OK, this is what I want to do and this is how I want to do it"". I took the chances that came my way and made the best of it. I knew there were no guarantees but having a general idea of what I wanted to get done was empowering. Sure, the ""getting done"" parts were painful and frustrating - it has taken me a year to get over some of the challenges and just this week I saw the light (or glimmer of it). "
ENTJ,"Eg. 2 - Earlier this spring I had considered the possibility of going for a second masters degree (MTS) since I would be able to do it online (thereby retaining my current job and not having to move) and for nearly free. But after consideration of the current busyness level of my schedule decided that, though free, it would not be worth the time right now. I would end up studying instead of refilling my extrovert tank and the degree would not in any way further my career. What I have chosen to do instead is go the autodidact route by reading books from syllabi of friends who have similar degrees and reading well-reviewed books on related subjects of interests on my own time."

It's mostly best if we just retreat until we have found our balance again. Just do nothing and focus on the things we CAN achieve."

He is clearly clueless about my feelings. I have tried studying psychology as a way to see if I can condition myself to not love him, but this was just destructive and unhelpful... so I accepted my feelings and tried to let go again, but letting go has proved impossible. He has been thinking of settling down, though I don't think he plans to act on this yet. He is still unsure, so I am stuck here, wondering if I should tell him anyway, before he really does decide to start a family with her, or do I stick it out?

ISFJ,I just had this experience last night and had to bring it up.  I was visiting some friends at a different university and we were with a group of about 15 and back from the bars pretty drunk.  It was a chaotic atmosphere but I noticed some conflict between two girls.  One of the girls was really disrespecting the other and called her a whore and said that she didn't like being roommates with her.  I saw the reaction of the girl as her eyes filled with tears and she turned her head and then went into the other room.  All the while there was drunken dancing to music and idiocy going on but that very human and emotional event made it impossible for me to stop feeling empathy for the girl who's feelings were hurt.  I've noticed that it's impossible for me to not be observant and empathetic.

ESTP,Well do you think he uses Te Si or Se Ti more? Does he like to live in the moment and go with the flow or organize everything logically and people also?    He can be a dick. Incredibly stubborn & condescending when he thinks he's right. He's hard to read because he is the type to 'live in the moment' ( very exciting and fun) but also very much a thinker type. He has preconceived judgments about the world about how stuff should be ( Te) based on tradition ( Si).  Yet he's very spontaneous and physically fit and loves to go to new places to indulge himself in debauchery ( Se) :P. I am aux Ti and thus a deep thinker to a certain extent.  I don't see him this way but maybe that's the difference between being an N dom and S dom. He states things very plainly and matter-of-factly concerned more about the 'right now' rather than future prospects.

Today they told him that they couldn't make it..I mean i guess I should have seen it coming and I probably did cos I wasn't that shocked. but i am still a little disappointed because I really wanted to go to the restaurant but my boyfriend said there's no point if we don't get a tatami room.

So I guess I wanted to give him space to think about what he wants in life.) He was hesitant about the break-up but I insisted. We still talk, but I do want some kind of direction to the relationship. He said he doesn't want to lose me as a friend. Do ISFJs really take time to commit fully or maybe he just really wants me as a friend?    You put him in a no win situation.

The only thing I can think of is that he has grown so accustomed to the filter that the sudden change threw him off, or maybe he was having a particularly bad day and vicariously released anger towards you. Is he very adverse to change? Some ISFJs can tolerate it more than others, and I'm still working on it myself. Revealing a part of yourself to him that you say makes you uncomfortable is something to be happy about and nurture.

That leaves us preferring to simply say nothing. ;-) INFPs, have the ""benefit"" of having a very verbal Ne aux. function. While their Fi is still dominant, their Ne, being facile, is able to, in a rather indirect manner, express enough to impress their sentiments--to evoke, not describe, to champion, not direct, etc. It can be amazing the difference one letter makes. ;-)    Whoa, I didn't expect, that much of explanation.

INTJ,"I don't consider myself to fit well into any sort of socially constructed gender identity, but I don't particularly care for pansexual or gender-neutral as a term either, since they seem to implicitly accept the validity of the other social constructions. When I use 'masculine' or 'feminine' as a term, I refer only to the social construct, with sarcasm as an inevitable part of that. I don't use them seriously, for I see no value in using them seriously. I don't even know what they would refer to if one did use them seriously. The bulk of it is just a stereotype. I'd rather deal with everyone on the level of 'human' regardless of how much or how little they fit expectations their society attaches to gender.    I like the way you think: We're all human, and we can still be male/female even if we don't fit the stereotypical roles assigned to us by society. If anything, people like us can serve as role models, and show others that we don't have to fit a mold, since we're all individuals first, anyway. I'll admit, I've caught a lot of slack for showing stereotypical feminine traits, such as empathy and affection, but it has been a strength more than anything, since I feel I can understand where both males and females are coming from, to an extent. Many social scientists already agree that most differences between the two are due to external factors, and although I doubt we'll ever have both 100% equal in every way someday, I'm sure we can bridge the gap. We have more in common than society would like to have you believe. "

Again, it was hard for me to fully motivate myself, because a part of my brain is still aware of my unconscious.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ferroequinologist   Most Ne types that are really and obviously Ne types show up quick--at least to me. Ne is like an explosion of words, jumping from topic to topic in what could be called a random order, but there is either a common thread to it all, or a series of connections, regardless of how loose. Se is more searching around in circles for the same thing (possibly the weaker Ni). With this combo, and Se in the fore, one tends to repeat in different ways, seeking for an apt expression to say the same thing, only better. It's like it's prodding and prodding, ever poking inward, and more precisely over time. I think that Ni, when it's stronger is more prone to just say it aptly the first time around, and to repeat more for effect. "

ISFJ,"Its also important to realize tradition can be engineered and created anew as time goes on. Following tradition isn't necessarily a follower only thing. For example creating the tradition of turning off your phone/electronics after 10pm. Or playing only a certain hour of video games per day. If a tradition doesn't have a purpose, it's dumb. Things like brushing your teeth, eating breakfast, exercising... They are all done with a purpose. "

Higher density air (cold air) ""sinks"" below the the warmer air, forcing the warmer air up.

The energy dissipates into the surrounding matter leaving the air cooler, the density increases, it sinks."

Thank you, that's intriguing. Actually, in the mean time we discussed this and became a couple, though it was kinda iffy.

With my Ne, mostly I'm only able to do short term intuitive leaps, such as understanding a concept, or creating something new, seeing into the future is harder for me.  Can you guys describe your source of knowledge of the future.  Do you relate it to things that have already happen, or do you methodically go through all of the possible results picking the one most likely using the data given.  This also seems to be the source of your incredible plan creating skills.  If you can effortlessly see into the future, creating a plan becomes instantaneous and effortless.

INTP,"I'm thinking about the implications of being born into a personality type, and what that means for freewill. If I'm free to do what I want, and what I want is what I prefer, and what I prefer is determined by personality type, and personality type is determined by birth. Then seeing as how I can't choose my birth, my personality type or my preference - can I choose what I want? I think the answer is obvious; yes. But if I'm prone to do something, and it makes me unhappy if I don't do it - that means what I want is basically what I prefer, I think the reason why this isn't consistent is because I can't always get what I want or at the right price or effort. But that's way too simplistic, and it doesn't take factors like beliefs or knowledge into account, and how interested or tired I am of a subject/object. Still, I think some sort of model should be applicable, but only useful if one is able to fully read people. But people are subject to change, not completely, but into better (or worse) versions of themselves. The margin of error would be too great, and people would have had to cooperate. It's ethical use is another issue, to be able to fully predict a person - Then again I think that's what speed reading is for, but apparently I don't have the right functions (idk)."

Now I know.  But is it really a thing? I mean in real life somewhere out there. Only time I've seen 'the number of the beast' being a deal, has been in Hollywood films. Just asking, in case if I have to know if it might actually offend someone. idk."
ESTP,Originally Posted by arcticdome   When you realize your Infp friends are some of your truest friends you have.    I think that's true. I was just thinking about it in the morning.
INFJ,sometimes the generation gap feels a mere foot across. sometimes it feels more similar to the grand canyon
ENTJ,"This is very similar to my ENTJ teacher who is known to be ""tough"" and ""strong"" and all of kids fear her. Luckily, I am an EXPERT at the subject that she teaches, so I don't have to try to be her pet. As usual, I eagerly show that I don't fear of ""authority figures"". I respect them (if they deserve that), but I fear none. I have noticed that the easy-going ones, who seem like ENFPs or ISFPs or ESFJs tolerate me and find my playfulness and child-like energy and ""focusing skills"" to be cute in a way. Of course, I am an excellent student and I blow them away with my essays and projects and mostly when we have debates on certain topics (as it is expected from an ENTP )"
ISTP,My old (very chatty) hairdresser asked me the same set of questions every time  Then when convo ran dry he went on about my much more charismatic ENFP sister  He also had a weird obsession with cutting my fringe off (even though anything above my chin does not suit me even slightly) 
INTP,"Originally Posted by lastman   These 2012 presidential candidates make me excited for election day. You know, so I can stay home. There. I said it. Deal with it. Is what I just posted on twitter.     You and me both.  Wake me up in 2016 please."

ESFJ,Your/peoples feelings cant be ....wrong...they can just be.
ISTP,"Instead I usually frequent the ones around Bethlehem, especially when Musikfest is going on."
INFP,"Sorry if I'm imposing.    You're not imposing. Thank you for replying. I think there is definitely some kind of anxiety at the root of my shyness. I think it has always been there and probably always will be, I don't think it's something which can be solved by any kind of professional because its just so complex. So i think I just have to accept it as part of myself."
INTP,"Its not something I can stop. Not too sure about the ""feeling the extent of our current emotions""..."
ISFJ,"Nearly all ISFJs will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and nourish these strengths:  You are adept at seeing the right balance, the best way to make the world look and feel good. This talent enables you to make your world reflect your inner self and become a place of security and growth in which others can feel at ease too. You have a gift for knowing what will make another person feel better about the world and themselves. Your valuable input to their world comes back to you in ways which aid your own personal development. You see clearly what is right and wrong, what grates on yourself and others, what works for harmony and what does not. Your clear recognition of these things gains you the confidence and respect of others. You have a great memory for things, places and events, their curious details and the relationships between them. More than this, you also remember what was both good and bad about these things. These skills show in your ability to give no nonsense advice and aid to others. Within yourself you know, even if others do not realise it, that for as long as they are trying to do their best, you will hold the line with them to the very end. You see this as simply doing the right thing, but in fact it is a special virtue and makes you one of the most worthy of partners and friends when the chips are down. You work hard to get the job done, and you can be counted on the stay with it till it is finished.  ISFJs who have a strongly express Extraverted Feeling function will find they also enjoy these special gifts:  Work is never a chore to you, but a gift you offer to the world. In your relationships you are able to clearly show others how you feel about them. Others will always feel at ease in your home and presence. Your efforts always seem to be appreciated by those around you. You will try to find pleasing ways to settle differences and to find the most satisfying solutions to both your own and others' difficulties. More often than not, you will know exactly the right thing to do, say, buy or create to make things better or move things toward a valid human solution to a problem. You will clearly see the conditions underlying a situation and their effects on the persons within it, enabling you to see ways of changing things for the better. In this sense, you may be a powerful agent for social justice.  http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISFJ_per.html"
ISFJ,"3- actually had this happen a couple months ago. I'd only interact a couple times (meaning only like or comment 2/3x), until they started interacting with me as well. I have to stop myself from being the person who interacts much more, and try to match my amount to his. I love interacting online because I can express myself better and have time to control my interactions."

INTP,"yay! i have my comp in my room now.... for all of, 1 year, before i go off to college...."
ESTP,He was the only one in the 'normal' group that laughed at my dead baby joke.
ISFP,"Before anyone takes me seriously, please just ignore me. I'm a dumbass but I'm not in any immediate danger ... and I'm genuinely not doing this for attention, just screaming into the void and running away before I can hear the echoes. "
ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Magnificent Bastard   I'm lost. But I think I'll stick around..    Lost?  Or ""stalking"" ??   LOL"
ESTP,"She fits about every single thing ESFP's say about themselves. That's the only thing that I saw that showed evidence to the contrary. I thought it was important and pronounced enough, though, to probably rule her out as an ESFP. But what do you think?    I'm pretty sure every type can be stubborn. I'm not sure that's really something that comes with MBTI type. But I could be wrong."
ISFP,Are you prone to cutting ties with someone when you move away?
INTP,"If I met the man who murdered my grandmother, and had the option of making him experience panic attacks as punishment, I don't think I would. Literally crushing his nuts with 2 bricks would be a less severe punishment."
INFP,"Though I've never been to ontario I actually hear alot of negative things about it, even though it always seemed like a cool place from what I've read, seen on the tele..."
ENTP,"Say, why don't ""naked"" and ""baked"" rhyme? I was trying to write some serious poetry about being baked and naked the other day, but hot damn, the words don't rhyme. Seriously, who invented english?"
ISFJ,I'm not sure that sentence really conveys how happy your comment made me. 
INTJ,"Originally Posted by heroid   Are you all INTJs like that listen to the story: I have this INTJ classmate, and im an ENTJ, she studys a lot and shes really intelligent but she doesn't hang out with other people, only with her cousin and another classmate, we're in the same class since elementary (also now in high school) she tells me to shut up sometimes, we have quality conversations from time to time but when i see her in the street and try walking with her she says stuff like, i don't want to walk with you, or you may go away, and stuff like that, how can i get her to be more friendly? or is all hope already gone?    I can't help but think about an episode I had as a kid walking home from school. I'm a male, but this other guy would intercept me every time the class ended, because he wanted to walk with me on his way home. It's not that I didn't like the guy, but all of this small-talk makes absolutely no sense to me, and is just generally a bore. He didn't think so, so he would bully me into stay. Oddly enough we became friends later because I found that we shared interests (Computers and video games)."
ENTP,Do you ENTPs also have problems of mistyped ENTP-imposters?
ISFJ,"According to the socionics physical description along with other traits including left-handedness, as well as my daily interactions considered, I have been typed ISFJ. It's rather disappointing, as rational logic is much more productive in the pursuit of your goals. They say that feeling/thinking is a choice you make around 13 years of age, I do not remember making this choice."
ESTJ,To think all this started with the Beta/Delta interaction. :P
ENTP,"I suddenly understand why I am single. Not that I look like that, but I just assumed that all men were like my dad and brothers: it's all ok as long as it's not asymmetrical or ""too special""."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by Brian1   I've studied up on this a lot, no one asks us these questions.  At least from my experience.  I think a lot of N types,not saying all, just a lot, have this innate ability,I studied philosophy got a B, of right and wrong, and they say ""because it is, because we said so"" and that makes them think they don't need to investigate to see if they are right.  They are right, why contradict their internal data?  So, they need to paint an excuse and sell it as fact, and that's where they develop the idea that all of us are insensitive to the needs and wants of others.  Well, from where I'm sitting, no one has articulated their needs wants and sensitivities to me to take into consideration.  People say they're sensitive like a snowflake.  Well, snow naturally melts if the conditions are right. Why should I be blamed if people are going to use that metaphor?    I see what you mean  but let me be sure; are you saying that because you believe others have the ability to process complicated philosophical issues that since they feel internally (subjectively) right that this is reason enough to believe that they are actually, objectively right? There's a difference between subjectivity and objectivity, and this is where most of our conflicts as human beings arise... we tend to butt heads because of it. It's one thing to have an opinion on something and to believe that opinion applies to everyone, but it's a much different thing to actually prove it. I do not take peoples opinion seriously at all, when they state something, I want clarification, if not, than they are just pulling shit from their underwear and eating it ""just cuz"". This is the exact way I perceive and feel about extrovert types, or your type specifically. It's just the way your minds work that make me repulsed... sure, you have fun... but who cares when you're hallow. I'll state this as subjective, just to avoid an in-depth debate..... but really... I strongly feel this is the case for most of your type and those closely related. Empty minds, restless bodies... always searching for the next neural fix... chasing that biological dragon.   "
ISFP,"If they overreact for nonlegit reason I may sympathize anyway because I am actually sympathizing with the act of overreacting, not what they overreacting to... Or perhaps for some other motive. Maybe because I am trying to communicate something else they need to hear in order to be happy like, ""you are doing this to yourself, only once you take responsibility can you find your way to happiness"", or, ""you've been doing such-and-such pattern for a  few years now, have you ever thought about XYZ?"" -- or ""yes, that was sure awful, I don't know what to say"", or, ""yeah I know they are jerk, but you're bigger than that, k? cry it out and feel what you need to feel as long as you need to, and then set yourself free to get beyond this; I'm here, k?"", or ""I totally understand; but it won't last forever"" -- only if such input is acceptable of course. I will not reason with the unreasonable; or cheer the uncheerable; or least of all, make false promises; also, Navajo proverb, ""you can not waken someone who is pretending to be asleep""; I only give what people want, granted sometimes they don't know immediately that they want it; and I can just as easily communicate most of this nonverbally, sometimes just by being there and saying ""I know, I know"" or more often saying nothing -- which often works better (many people already have the answers, they just need empathy/presence in sorrow/space in sorrow/no pressure for 5 minutes). All you can do is love them or walk away (or both). In that case, I do what my heart says in that moment. And most of all, listen. So many people just need to find their voice; they don't need anyone else as long as they can find their own voice in it all. Sometimes a wall to bounce that off of is how we find our voice. My goal thus is to become a nonentity. Just to be. Flexible as the air that is breathed; yet solid as a rock. More than once I've been called anchor in the storm."
ISTJ,"It's the Ocean Lift scent/formula by Head and Shoulders. I liked it for the first month, but I think it's drying my scalp. I'm very tempted to go with Johnson and Johnson's Baby Shampoo for my next purchase."
ENTP,"(To be honest, I don't get along well with most ENFJs. I have dated one and had a few ENFJ friends, some of which were very lovely people. But our ideals tend to clash, and I can find their dominant personalities overbearing at times.)    enfj and infj are the two types which IMO have the biggest variance between men and women.   "

ISFJ,  -When you'll find any excuse possible to go into work even when slightly sick and then feel concerned that you may have made others sick after actually heading into work.
ESTP,Is it too 'out there'?    Huh. That's not Ni. That's pretty much Se. You're viewing people like objects to be manipulated in the real world. You're in-tune with what is required to do that in the here and now. Relating time and space (basically spatial awareness) is also mostly correlated with Se.

ENFP,"ESFPs always surprise me as well. Things often fly over their head and they'll say something that always has me wondering ""WTF is wrong with you, what kind of thought process do you use?""

ISFJ,"We got together under circumstances I'm not used to. We were just friends at the beginning. I saw him as someone I needed to help me with a dance lesson and someone to invest time into so that he could become a better dancer for the school's club. He saw me similarly. So there were no idealizations of his character, no standard in my head that he had to live up to. He was just his dorky goofy self and it was okay because I didn't have that full-on crush on him."
INTP,"I do wonder, though, what events from my lifetime will go down as 'worthy' history. I think the last notable things to happen were during all the civil rights movements and things, and now as it's all getting more and more liberal, there is less struggle so less major stuff is happening."
ENTJ,"EDIT: preferably ENTJ- specific responses, as I would like to compare experiences of those with inferior Fi/ Te Dom cognitive functioning capacity."
ISFP,Anime taught me more in life than school+real people.
INFP,"Being a sculptor, I also have been thinking about such things quite a lot lately. At times though, I have hope that a new paradigm will arise where people aware of balance - where technology is known as a tool to preserve the essence of being human, we still perform the gestures of work, which as of now are stunted by functional objects that can do almost everything for us. My thought process is that, if you and I can realize that there's something wrong with the direction society is going, I'm sure there are others. It just takes a few great minds in each field to turn things around. The question is when and whom?"

INTP,I have just spent the last hour devising alternate scenarios for something that happened previously.
ISTP,"That is actually one thing from my childhood I actually liked. When I was 7 I went to an extravagant party in Hollywood for my one year old cousin. My aunt describes me at that time as having eyes like saucers. There was a lot to look at. Bongo players. Exotic foreigners (not just my people, but Italians, French, etc) smoking ciggies or slouching about with fashionably messy hair and glamorous clothing. I was like shit parties are a giant play, a suspension of reality, heightened emotions, exciting. I didn't know how to act, but the sensory overload made up for that feeling, and to this day it's the same. "

Is there ever such a thing as too much stimulation for you? Because I originally meant overstimulated in the sense of being too stimulated, leading to being burnt out. But maybe you don't relate as much to this. I guess by stimulation, I meant positive stimulation."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by ai.tran.75   I think INFP and enfp have a lot in common.

INFJ,"Therefore, I am eternal. Bow before me (all of us?), puny mortals!"
INFP,"So I find someone a little bit like me, quickly imagine (it's more like I ""know"", so much so that I don't bother to check) that they are more like me than they are, raise them onto the highest pedestal imaginable for a while then when they do something so minor that they don't even realise it's bad I move back to my current state of self loathing, sure that they are happier without me despite believing myself to be everything anyone could want.  I have a text message sitting on my phone from one who fell not long ago for not believing me about something stupid and childish that I just cannot answer.  It asks ""how are you?"" but finishes with a happy smile because she is going on holiday.  She doesn't want the truth, that I hate myself right now in a large part because I dislike her for something so pathetic, and indeed I don't want to tell her; she knows I will not lie, I love her too much for that (although she still doesn't understand this).  I cannot risk darkening her holiday even slightly by saying something yet know by saying nothing she'll know there is something wrong... I'm hurting her either way, unless I lie and pretend my world smells like roses   She knows more about why I am as I am than anyone, even than I knew myself a month ago, and somehow only contacts me when I feel worthless.  It's like she knows...  Yet when we meet we're like two strangers, she will share nothing of herself and I have nothing left to share.  Everyday at work I look at her parting gift to me and am filled with more conflicting emotions than when watching a starving big cat eating a young deer on a nature program."
ESTP,"Also... why's your definition of ""good"" irrelevant? At this point, I'm starting to somewhat doubt that you even have one, but let me know what it is if you actually do."
INFJ,Sure someone's posted this before...hahaha...an INFJ mantra if you ask me...

I don't think we cried, though wearer said and besides the fact that I felt like I have to go because I loved her, I saw only good things coming out of it. I needed to say goodbye, like I said, maybe it's a Perceiver thing but we almost never really breake all connections with somebody. Even now I sort of feel of connection because the memories are still a part of me and I have some really great ones. Plus as I was doing it I was also realising I'd have to do that for my parents too sometime in the future and while it will not be very soon it hit me that I need to make good use of the time I have left with them. It made me appreciate a lot of things even more... I don't generally run from experiences even if they seem negative or with the possibility to bring me down a bit because I can always learn something from them and I feel these make me grow as a person, be more mature. I think every experience we live prepares us for something else, it's a step we needed to take. But I'm not a Fe dominant type, I don't let the emotions of those around me influence me that much, they don't affect me as much as it would affect you so in the end you know what is best for you. I don't know maybe if was also that we don't dead death that much, I don't think anybody shed a tear and we did love her alot. I felt we gathered there to show we loved her and to say goodbye.

When my parents argue, I would either confront them and be the middle man and have them meet halfway or just tell them to shut the f... up and make up because everyone can damn well hear them.(this hardly ever works and they stare at me and tell me to wipe my dirty mouth, damn hyprocrites. ""are you using a dirty word?"" uhhh damn isn't a swear word mother..."""
INFP,Also I think that you can learn many things about yourself being in this situation
ENTP,After about 7 years of holding out I had to be realistic about it and and came to the conclusion that:
ENFP,"Don't mind loud, crowded places, either.  I'm easily amused, so I can have fun with or without company wherever I am, so location is never a problem."
ESTP,"I mean, this is probably beyond what you would usually do with an aquaintance, uh, right?  He sounds a little stressed, my initial inclination is to want to give him a backrub to relax him.  "
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by CorgiGirl   More craziness. I'm not even venting anymore, I just can't believe someone would actually say this stuff so I'm going to repeat it. So my housemate comes out of her room and notices that I have the couch's swingout footrest out. She didn't know that it had footrests, so she said ""it moves back? Maybe we should move the TV out here. But I kind of like it in my room."" Ok, there's so many things wrong with that statement. The fact that she called her TV ""the TV"" kind of indicates to me that it's the only one and that mine doesn't exist. Sorry that mine's small and isn't hooked up to cable. And I'm not even sure what makes her think that a cool add-on to a couch means that we should move her TV out here into the living room (who knows where she was planning on putting my TV). Does she think it will be more comfy and therefore gives her incentive to not hang out in her room the entire time? But I guess not that much incentive. But eh, I guess I shouldn't complain too much, I got a free desert out of accompanying her to Starbucks.    Wouldn't this actually solve your problem? Now, you get to watch in living room which is nice and comfy as you wanted and also with a big TV which is hooked to the cable. Its almost a win- win situation. Or did I miss something?"
ENFJ,"Don't worry, I'm not offended. I tend to come off strong too, but I still end up speaking somehow. ;]"
INTP,"I feel like my ideas and intellectual whims are like children to me. It is utterly heartbreaking to abandon them when I have, by community standards, ""more important things to get done"". I'm working on how to not follow every intellectual whim that doesn't further my overall priorities. "

ISFJ,"What would be the ideal way for someone who cares about you to respond when you are feeling sad? I always feel better when I talk with other people about my feelings but my ISFJ daughter doesn't seem to want to talk about her feelings right away. It takes some time alone and then eventually she'll come and talk about it. Do you just need time to process this internally first? As an extrovert, I obviously feel like getting it out in the universe is what helps move things along. What goes on in your mind during that alone time? Are you beating yourself up a lot or thinking it's every one else's fault? (I get that's super generalizing... just curious!) "
ENFJ,"Moreover, in every discussion, most everyone seems to contribute ideas, except Eric. I feel like he's just bandwagoning on the most recently presented idea at all times. If you'll recall from the leadership meeting at his house, I presented the whole concept of the circle icebreaker, and he thought it was a fantastic idea. Then, Dennis and Vivek said that they still thought it was necessary to have a presentation. Strangely enough, all of a sudden the circle icebreaker is insufficient."
ENTP,"(Actually, you might even be able to get the ENTP to pay you a stipend for cleaning the house. ENTPs don't like dealing with that.)"
ISTP,"Also, Martin Freeman's face is made of children's laughter."
INFJ,"I really wish I had no Fe sometimes. Like, whatever type has no Fe. I want to be that type right now. I'm so exhausted. I want to shove a pen in my eye to drain the blood that has swelled in my head from my brain bursting. That's about it. That is all."
ISFP,"What do you think about ISFP?    Haha, I do the awkward heart-felt praise thing too."

ISTP,"I wasn't scared for one moment -despite finding feces in my pants later, but thats unrelated-"
INFP,It baffles me how little some people seem to care about their education. Especially college education. SOmetimes I just want to ask these people who exactly is paying for their education and if they are I want to ask what made them decide to go in the first place. I mean if you're avidly against learning a damn thing why the hell do you have to ruin everyone else's experience?
ISTJ,"Best bet is to talk this over with her, and start looking on Craigslist for a replacement roommate. Ask her to wait at least another month. I haven't taken real estate law, but this might be helpful. Of course, laws differ by jurisdictions. Small claims court might be another route to go if you're willing."

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Handsome Jack   No, I completely agree. Wasn't going to call out the Fi-doms on their tendency to set unrealistic goals but now that you mention it ... throw Ti + Ne in that mix, baus.    Fi and Ti doms have unrealistic goals and Ne doms have unrealistic explanations. All of my Fi dom friends have studied something that's not going to help them to find jobs... When their Te get stronger they just learn to be more effective doing something they like/ that doesn't pay the bills. They need to suffer and fail before they are ready to focus on something else than their feelings - actually they need to see that logic can help them with feelings they don't wanna feel (like pain and misery). It's a long path... But basically learning to use pure Te would save them. "

INTP,"This is worst possible thing that could have happened to me. I mean - yes, he thinks he is perfect (without him I wouldn't believe there are still such people).

ENTJ,"Concepts are a completely different thing.  History, historical costume, historical figures, the ideology in differing periods, etc. is interesting to me.  Why?

ISFP,"So here I am half-awake, fretting over this impossible, unnecessary problem, when I should be getting some sleep, and what is really frustrating me about it more than anything is that the real answer -- ""no we don't need to determine who's cough is whose to cure them of it, sound has no meaning if we have the knowledge of who to give cough-syrup to, we can see  which people are coughing, duh!"" -- is on the tip of my intellect, and I cannot quite find it or inject it into this dream state. I know it but I can't think of it. I'm helpless and feel responsible."
ESFP,"Ex: We were having a family dinner a few Saturdays ago... the boy brings his Fear plushie (character from Inside Out) into the restaurant.

When his mom tries to address and scold the behavior grandma cuts her off and says don't be so hard on him.  Then after the meal takes him to get two new toys and a freaking birthday cake for his plushie doll..."
ISFJ,"Yes, this has definitely been me from time to time with extreme extroverts (most recently an ENFJ). But I would say if the friendship is strong enough, I am okay with saying I needed space. It might always be a struggle to say ""no,"" but we can definitely learn to take care of ourselves."

May also use it to solder together some sheet metal for sculptures and my plate mail for a larping event.    Now you're just trying to be seductive."

When you are younger and surrounded by them they can really get into ""mob mentality"" and the ones I knew would laugh at things that they didn't understand or sometimes even hear if they thought it would put someone that they thought was strange on the spot and make them look bad. My stepdad was an ESTJ and had a very ""my-way-or-the-highway"" approach to everything. Even when I would explain a more efficient alternative. I remember being a kid arguing with him for hours about things like why I should be allowed to sleep with my door closed, or why 10:30 was a more appropriate bedtime. Though, with age I have come to understand them, and my stepdad and I get along MUCH better now that I am a grown man. One of my closest friends for years is an ESTJ and while I do see him as somewhat of a conformist, he's a good guy at heart(same with my stepdad). Though, the ones I know do seem completely not open to the idea of interacting with people that they have heard are ""weird"". They also seem to be completely devoid of any imagination."
ESTJ,"OP, the only one I disagree with on your list is ""direct and truthful when communicating with others"". While they are often truthful and easy to read, their communication style can be indirect and they often imply things instead of stating them explicitly. For example, they may phrase a statement in the form of a question, and expect the listener to take it as a statement. The first instance that comes to mind is when my little brother eats with his fingers, my ESTJ father will say ""DO YOU HAVE A FORK!?"" instead of ""use your fork"". Bad example, but it is one of many."

It does seem that many of them are by teenagers/young people about their parents which is understandable as I guess a lot of young people feel they don't like their parents.  
ESTP,I personally was a mixed bag. I made the mistake of trapping myself into a situation where I locked myself inside a single room and started doing drugs.

I don't know college/school it's just  NOT for me,I'll still of course drone on feeling like a robotic being in a sea of sameness. Do most people have a REAL reason to go to college? I feel like we don't.were told this is what you do to fit in with society to become introduced fully into what the society wants you to be.It's sickening and I hate being apart of it,I guess I have to be though really keep marching keep droning becoming one of them. The robots of life.    I know how you feel. My last year was a repeat of the year before, redoing my coursework and exams because I failed them so badly the first time. Now I'm approaching actually finishing my work and getting ready for my final exams. It feels like I'm just forever repeating myself, and I don't see the point. When I get annoyed with myself for not finishing stuff and not doing well I always realise how pointless it all is, how formulaic and controlling it can be."
ENFJ,"But to see and to know that I have that strength and with the right amount of emotion, I could do damage like that... it's a little... *forgive me for saying this, really* impressive. "
ESTP,"Do you grow bored, easily? Yes, I am right now...that is why I am on here.  :P"
INTP,"I am lately thinking, whether I should post newest idea of theory combining MBTI and Enneagram with order of birth or not. Hmm, maybe after I'll start working on it."
ENTJ,- Not procrastinating or avoiding your obligations 
INTP,"or it means that writing is too slow compared to your thinking speed, so you get bored with writing and thus want to do it as quickly as possible and thus it looks like an EEG graph. conclusion: typing is better.    Typing is too slow too sometimes :P"
ENFP,"OMG NO! He did NOT go after Aphrodite..............He knew she was gonna turn him down. She will always have a thing for Aries, all muscle and bad attitude.

ISTP,"How much would it take to appear that way? I know that I always used to get flack when I went shopping with others because I'd ""disappear"" to the next aisle without saying anything and I guess my shoes don't make enough noise for most people to notice. Maybe the biggest thing that may resemble something like that would be appearing quiet and neutral to others, content to just observe what they're doing. Despite trying to keep my senses keen to what others are doing when I still lived with a cat(like an actual cat, not someone who reminds me of one.) She would get the drop on me and scare me because she was so quiet. "
ISFJ,"actually no, but who cares. The End certainly was great as well, a true fucking epic.

INFP,But I'm so scared...because he said before we got off the phone that he might join the Army instead of the marines because there are more benefits. But I'm so worried that he'll get hurt or killed and I don't want that to happen cos I don't know what I'd do then. He said that half of him wants to stay so I won't be upset and half of him wants to go to see if he can do it.
ESFP,"IF there is a problem, it's likely because we're at different stages of our lives or some other unavoidable issue and not because there's a fundamental disparity with how we 'roll.   "
ESTJ,"A few things stood out to me as being atypical of an ESTJ.  First of all, you're too abstract for an S.  It seems to me your thinking on these issues and relationships are anything but grounded and concise.  Your tangents on yelling and the dilemma on whether or not to give aid to Africa are two examples of inductive logic--expounding on a smaller example into the larger issues involved.  Inductive logic is often preferred by Idealist/NF's, as is your focus on relationships and people.  Guardians (SJ's) prefer linear ways of thinking which would avoid taking on such tangential topics.  "
ISTJ,"I'm totally derailing the thread here, but I was curious how you determined you're an INFJ? I only ask because at times I don't feel very INFJ-ish, but you seem even less INFJ than I do at times. Not that I am an expert at typing people, nor would I suggest what type you might be, but I was just curious :D"
ISTJ,"I guess that wasn't completely fair, some SJs can be immature. Just, in the friends i see currently, the SJs are the most mature in the group."

ESTP,"But I'm basing this on the four sides of the mind presented by CSJoseph*. According to him and his research, the subconscious is the side of you that you can enter either through aspiration or insecurity. My Ni is definitely the source of a lot of my anxietys so i'm still far from being able to get there. He also did a video about transitioning into other sides of the mind and used an ESTP as a basis which is quite cool.**"

As it turns out she has many, and once, I knew what I was doing and I knew what ""thread"" (no pun intended  ) to pull, but I started talking about something (on purpose) that reminded her of something from her love life and she started to cry.

ISTP,"Originally Posted by cursive   Are you going to the dentist? *she asked, worriedly*"
ESFJ,"When you can maneuver yrself through a lot of different interests in conversation because your primary interest is people, and you find you are actually interested in a little about a lot too.

I can see that in myself too sometimes but not all the time."

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Memphisto   This made me laugh... Because the other day ISTJ called me and he was concerned that he hadn't taken his vitamins in a week.  He said they were to big and he couldn't swallow them because he felt like he was going to choke.  I thought about it after our conversation and was trying to think of a way to help...and than, AHA!  Gummy vitamins!  I went online and compared the ingredients in the vitamins he takes to the gummy vitamins and they were exactly the same.  So now he takes his gummy vitamins every day. :)  The only problem now is making sure that he only takes two a day like he's supposed to instead of eating to many....lol.  Ooh he makes me smile.      This made me laugh, I'm imagining a really serious ISTJ eating gummy vitamins, and it's hilarious."

ENTP,Uh... What is love?    First: Sarcasm is in the eye of the beholder.
ISTJ,We see more young staffs working as bank tellers because once they gain experience they tend to take courses and work at higher positions. Those who just graduated from school would get hired as bank tellers since they don't have any working experiences. So we always tend to see younger staffs than older staff as bank tellers.

INTJ,"Originally Posted by dalsgaard   It's also quite confusing when you're attempting to learn the language. American and English are extremely similar, but all the fine nuances keep getting mixed up in my head involuntarily, because I couldn't distinguish between the two before I became proficient. Many non-native speakers mix up accent and pronunciation. I've been told, for instance, that I have an English accent with an American pronunciation. That's not really ideal!! But it's also quite hard to do something about when you're always surrounded by both languages and not a single one. As usual, I blame Hollywood.    I have a Brazilian friend who learnt English when she came to the UK 5 years ago.  She went off to America for one year, ended up having a baby, and came back talking about 'diapers' and 'pacifiers'.  We had to teach her English all over again."
ISFP,"As a highly ""sensual"" person, I find meaning and a degree of intimacy in physical touch, even more playful touch. I only initiate hugs with people I actually feel very close to. And it doesn't take much for me to jump from being comfortable hugging someone to being comfortable cuddling with them or sleeping on their arm on a long bus trip. That said, a glass and half of wine will make me easily override any boundaries I still had about being touchy-feely with someone!"

Sure, I'm a busy college student and I prefer to take an evening to read a book, or write for a while rather than.. well.. doing what I'm doing at this moment, but I could never go cold-turkey on internet usage. I definitely believe the internet is the most powerful tool we have in society, and it's incredibly mesmerising to think all sorts of knowledge is only a few keystrokes and clicks away, but also one can definitely become addicted in the sense of not progressing with real life applications of knowledge or actually taking time away from a screen."

It doesn't seem very interesting to see what someone will do when you press their buttons, there's only three options: either they're going to step up and match you every step of the way, shit themselves, or just ignore you and remain satisfied in knowing they're right."

ISFJ,"When reading a book for example, do you imagine the descriptional part (for example landscapes, rooms, objects brought in sight by description) as being given, can you easily imagine what the book requires to create in your mind?    I tend to visualize the landscape in my head, which is probably why I'm a bit of a slow reader; I like to build a mental landscape. A lot of times the landscape is a combination of the book description and my own creation. My own creation is a mix of my imagination and memories of landscapes from real life. For example, I may envision a fictional town to be much like my hometown, which I adapt to fit some of the book descriptions, which kind of makes it a new town. Also, I tend to picture houses I have memories of as settings for some of the plot, but the yard/location may look different."

I always feel bad about it afterwards and apologize.  I know that I have no room to talk not being the best role model of fitness myself, but I'm young and I don't completely let myself go like that, either.

ISFP,"What I have realized is that whatever one's Dominant/Parent extraverted function is, the person really needs their personal inverse of that to be cared for. So in this case, with you, your Parent function is Se which is extraverted Sensing. That is ALL about giving other people good experiences. You are completely focused on how others are experiencing things. Your inverse of that or your unconscious critic is Si or introverted Sensing, which about your own personal experiences. Basically, because you have a Parent function of Se you secretly want good experiences yourself and feel like you shouldn't. So you being able to be honest with your wife about that in the first place is so awesome. And you should care about your experience, absolutely."
INFJ,"isn't that exactly what we are doing? pretty much any existing society is a mixture of capitalism and welfare systems. people argue about which one of those we aren't enough, but and devalue the amount of shared value or economical liberty they already had in order to justify the point that they should have more of it, but... those are still major aspects of society as we know it.    It's different. Instead of working collectively we work for ourselves. Instead of sharing materials in order to exist not just as a society, but as a species, we work for pieces of paper that are slowly losing their value as the days pass. We're basically talking about a society set up like the Native Americans before European involvement (yes, I do realize they had their own flaws, but they fought to survive, not for selfish desire) and comparing that to the U.S. today (or any other country really...)"

ENTJ,"Staying too long in once place also slows down your ability to earn more, if you are not in a sales capacity. Most increments are in the 2-3% range; new job applications generally allow for 20-40% pay increments. Again, relative to industry, designations etc. etc. The downside is your resume will look problematic. Conservative firms and hiring managers (which makes about 90% of them) will think you're a problem if you're seen to jump jobs a lot. Coincidentally, one hiring expert once made a very good observation: if the resume shows transition - going from strength to strength - even if it is constant change of jobs, then you have a very rare breed of candidate, which if you are hiring for performance - then these are the people you look for."

I think objectivity is clearer...I like being fair but at the same time, I can't ignore the needs and sensitivities of other people. What a struggle.    Neither can I. I don't ignore it. I acknowledge it, but logic always takes precedence. For example, I can feel sympathy for someone whose problems are of their own making, but I will never say 'you poor thing'. I expect people to take responsibility. I will say 'I feel for you, but you did it to yourself'. Perfect example (don't hate me) - women who put themselves in very risky situations (drunk and high at a frat party, for example) who are assaulted. It's like going to the zoo and jumping into an enclosure with lions and then complaining about being mauled. Bad judgement, very bad result, as a consequence of doing something very foolish that a person should know not to do.

I know a few members have chosen to label themselves gender-neutral, and pansexual, which makes me wonder how common it is, and how accepted these choices would be for other INTJs.

ENTJ,"ENTJs, having strong Te, are more supportive but only in a practical level. I would guess that INFP's Fe is stronger than ENTJ's Fe, so INFPs are probably more supportive of their partner in an emotional level. So, after you acquire great wealth, would the value of an INFP partner be greater than an ENTJ partner?    I wasn't conflating the idea of practicality with value. All people have inherent value, and I assume that they all have some utility in a social sense, hence the reasonably even distribution of personalities across similar cultures.

Your hands move the wheel incrementally to clip the apex as your foot is fluctuating the gas. You feel through your spine the torque in the rear wheels as the car tucks into the corner from more power being released by your right foot. You feel the grip reaching its edge as you give more and more gas and unwinde the wheel. The gs pulling you and the car away. The power pushing you in tighter. Then you are on the straight.

If I feel someone's very different from me, I will want to understand them and learn from them. And with getting older I simply admire their passion more.I do think that some FP males have a harder time just being themselves as they are constantly reminded by society that they don't live up to the masculin standards and should achieve more. This might render them more frustrated about life in general, but also see other men who succeed as people who accentuate their ""failures"" and raise the bar even higher.    Great points here, Riv. Thanks for the insight from the FP side, especially the bold part. It's hard to understand other people's way of thinking when the same things in life are obtainable given focus and hard work. That's probably why I don't understand the resentment. He has a problem with his girlfriend achieving more in life but it's not like he couldn't do the same. It's not like there's one cookie for everyone and we all have to fight for it. We can all get what we want so why bother going after someone pursuing their goals?"

He stills write and do book signings and is a pretty active public figure to the Vietnamese society. He's extremely deep, imaginative, has a deep understanding of people, can adapt and charm or have a conversation with anyone at any age from toddler like my son to people in their 90s , he's usually reading, researching or writing, he rarely ever sleeps , he enjoys collecting antiques and watches , he's very charming, charismatic, intelligent - I don't know - think Mark Twain but not as cynical but that's my uncle. Do I see myself in him? I wish! I suppose we share the same thinking cognitive functions and we are both curious, creative, idealistic, optimistic, imaginative , mystical, artistic and sociable- we share the same political point of view (both very liberal) and love for antiques or heirlooms , romantic  , and love for writing- however he's more outgoing than I am, much more sociable , still hang with friends, more passionate as to I'm more laid back ,he's still traveling around to do book signings and speeches . With that said- I get along with him quite well  , and looked up to him quite much- can't say that see myself in him but I am proud and thrill that he's an enfp :) never met any other ENFPs though- that's the main reason why I joined PerC - to communicate with other Enfps besides myself "

Light  touches on the arm while talking or sitting close are also safe  approaches to test the waters - if he quickly makes space for himself  you have your answer. The only thing I'll caution you about is your own tendency to over-analyze will go CRAZY with speculation if you play it safe and he's not reacting in a completely black or white way.    That makes pretty good sense now that you explain it, based on the way he was for years and how hes been the past 3 months. And maybe thatll be good too, to test the water first because id rather not get rejected by one of my best buds if theres no need. And I could definately do some playful touching! Lol"

ENFJ,As for the movie ... ugh .. our tastes don't match .. plus there's a couple of kids in the house so we can't put just anything on.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by MsBossyPants   What usually pushes my buttons is when someone close to me tries to get controlling with me.  It's hard for me to control my temper and think straight in that situation.  It's like they are kicking at my soft underbelly. It's more frustration, though.  I know that I have the ability to flay them with my words, so I hold back in order to preserve the relationship.  The aftermath of this usually requires some serious alone time to cool off.   And maybe some scotch.     Do you get irritated at being told what to do? I think it's one of my biggest pet peeves and I've wondered if it's related to type/functions. I don't know what it is exactly, but if I'm in the middle of something and start getting advised about the details of it, I get really flustered and it makes me lose my focus. Sometimes I just want to abandon it completely and move on to something else because it's been ""ruined"", lol."

INFJ,"I've been feeling a huge gap between my love and I over the past couple of weeks. It's beginning to be a concern. I'm not sure if I'm being the distant one or if he is and I'm not quite sure if this is something he and I need to discuss yet. Either way, I'm fairly t'd at him for deciding to stay up to watch a movie past midnight, keeping the volume extremely loud,  after I went to bed. It's strange to me how he can be so thoughtful about some things yet so ignorant about others. Now three hours later he's sound asleep next to me, a victim of his sleep aide while I'm stuck laying here wide awake listening to the sounds of his deep sleep and contemplating my complete discontentment in our relationship as of late. I am wondering if he is feeling it to. I am wondering if its just me and my feelings for him have shifted. For the most part I just feel neglected, almost abandoned. I know his feelings have not changed. I know that he is extremely focused on goals and work right now. And expects the same of me, but I'm feeling like dedicating myself to such focus will only widen the gap between us. I'm scared. And, not surprisingly, he doesn't get it. The last time I started to feel this way I was married to my ex husband and things didn't end well for either of us. I'm worried no action will only allow this to fester and grow, but I also feel that there is a chance I'm feeling discomfort for other issues a part from us. We have had a lot of changes happen in our lives. I'm wondering if it is all this change, the new environment, the realities of this move, anxiety over being in a new place and having to meet new people and start a new job... And all the while kicking and screaming inside because its just too much for me. Or the fact that he is putting a lot of pressure on me and on us to focus on work and making money even though its going to greatly shorten the amount of time we will have to spend together. I feel like I'm envisioning the absolute worst outcome of all this newness and time a part. I just feel like we are moving in two seperate directions and that scares me. I don't do well out in the wilderness alone. I tend to be vulnerable. Which also scares me. It also scares me having all this time I have to learn how to take care of myself for the first time in my life instead of someone else. I feel like a bird without a wing in this situation. And, I don't like it."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Poetic_Anarchy   Do you guys (and girls) put much thought into how you dress/look?

I'm not as much a fan of the lecture only classes, and much prefer the discussions, but the material is really interesting. I have a good Spanish teacher too, which is especially nice because my high school teachers really didn't teach me anything. Overall, I spend a lot less time in class and a lot less time doing actual work, so as long as I make sure not to become a recluse, it works for me.

I am just very frustrated with myself that I am not able to handle it as much as I thought I would, and I am having trouble listening to others opinions because I am stubborn about the fact that I have already thought about their opinion and I have already dismissed it in my own mind because it doesnt work. So then that makes me right..... I dont know. I'm pissing myself off. "

ESFP,"What annoys me about her a lot is the mind-reading thing and massive misreading into things. She needs to stop insinuating things and expecting me to not only pick up on it, but take the action she wants me to. Additionally, she will then tell me things like 'think more!' and other things I do take offensively. Intelligence is something I value greatly and the saying ""I live in my head' is very true for me. So to hear things like that or 'think ahead' are very hurtful. I try to remember that she's going through a phase many people I know are going through, she's 19 and I know that around that age many think they are mature adults and know better. It grates on me that my whole family treats me like an incompetent child and with her having been my best friend for a long time, it gets to me that she's taking on the same role of admonishing me. I hate this treatment and I hate seeing the surprised reactions when I do or say something that seems 'too adult and mature for childlike [my name]."

It seems that in my relationship, I am far more invested than she is. In fact, she's told me so - that she feels I love her much more than she loves me. Is this simply due to the ISFP's ability to standitalone, while INFJs can perpetually long for connection with their ""One?""   "

ISFP,"I like risk. I'm attracted to danger. I am free. I am brave. I am safe in my stupidities. I can take it. I can learn. I am resilient. Not invincible by any means -- just resilient.

And stop assuming and projecting that they are judging me by the same standard of edge or not, when they in fact are not, or even if they are, who cares? It's my edge or nonedge. It's who I am. It's where I am. It's what it is."
ENFJ,"But if it helps you to know someone relates, here's a little of my story, About a year ago this day I realized my relationship were completely fake because of me. They were all lies, not even accidentally crafted, but purposely by me. I couldn't stand it; everyone expected me to be something I wasn't. I would get so mad at myself for not being myself. To makes things a little more intense, one day I was about to die if I didn't get help. What was about to kill me was also making me really suicidal to make things worse, but there was not a single person I felt I could go to. I felt so alone because I didn't have a single non-fake relationship, not a single person I felt I could share what  I was going through or go for help. This experience made it painfully clear how fake my relationships were, so I decided I had enough being fake. I cut out ever person who had a fake relationship with me, which was well everyone who had a chance to have a relationship with me. In one day I fell off the face of the planet to my friends without any explanation, and for once, I took an action that showed how I really felt about things. I deleted them off of facebook and changed my phone number. For the first time I was alone, but I felt less lonely than ever. at least I was alone and authentic with myself. I felt free for the first time, and it felt like I found who I was for the first time because I wasn't so busy being something else for other people. I can say some relationships are just baggage to be carried around, and sometimes, you just have to take them off. Honestly I wish I was strong enough to carry them around. I wish I was strong enough to be authentic and myself around everyone, but until then, I put them down. Some day I hope  to pick them up when I'm stronger. But I have decided not go back to them until I'm stronger, and to  never go back just to feel that familiar weight to avoid feeling lonely. "

There does seem to be some sensitivity lacking in the narrative, perhaps because some people have been bulldozed or hurt by an ESTJ, but what I find very interesting reading through this forum is that this is the place where you can ask someone why they would behave that way. Did my boss make me cry because she's a mean person and gets off on seeing others cry? Or maybe was there another explanation? Doesn't change how you felt at that moment, but maybe if you understood a little more behind others reasoning for behaving certain ways, you could be a little more patient, or avoid conflict altogether."

What would a card game that involved imposing chaos/randomness on order be like? On the one hand, it'd have a lot more victory conditions - there's a lot more ways to be random than there are to be ordered. But at the same time, it's hard to generate true randomness algorithmically. I doubt that such a game would be fun. But how could it be done at all? How would you score such a thing?    "
INFP," There is not but one teacher I can honestly say genuinely values me for the being I am, and I can state likewise for most of my classmates, for while they are generally courteous towards me and polite, I can nonetheless sense the uneasiness they feel while surrounding me at given times, a lack of comfort that makes me feel as though I simply don't belong within their personal circle and instead am but a mere intruder from another remote realm whom has caused their stability to malfunction. I've tried to elude this pain by posting within forums centering around fictional anime characters, fictitious persons to which I can focus my attention on and direct platonic affection towards, knowing that they'd never be ones to judge or deem me a freak, and yet oddly enough, I likewise ponder at moments if even they would feel the same insecurity while around me as I feel most within human society do, or whether or not these nonexistent beings would ever appreciate me had they been ture real life creations I can converse with at all."

While I don't doubt that it's crucial to manage one's emotions the opposite must be said is true less ""managing"" and more living them in the moment.

I mean, it was pretty elaborate, it was around album release time and in my head I saw a track list and kept hearing the songs, which are not real songs but I liked them so my subconscious is a pop music composer, but whatever. Here's where it got weird though: a few of us were on a rooftop for some reason, probably like four to six stories high, but we were gonna get down by climbing these ladders. There were ladders on two corners of the building, so we split up and were gonna take turns going down. The first two people went, and then gaga was heading down a few seconds ahead of me. She got a grip of the top rung of the ladder and then boom, she accidentally let go and went flying down. And we all watched as this woman fell four to six stories and landed on her back, her head smacking the ground and her skull splitting, leaving a big splat of blood and brain matter, and her body bounced for some reason four times, leaving more blood every time her head hit. So all of us were freaking out in shock, like couldn't breathe but crying because we just saw someone die brutally and none of us could interfere. The few of us left hurried down to figure out what to do, and as soon as we got down, the body was not there. Blood puddles still there, but no gaga. So we went walking down the nearest alley and into a neighborhood reminiscent of my own, and BAM, lady effing gaga, in the flesh, fully alive. No blood, skull intact. And the psycho was just laughing at us, like gotcha, I didn't die, it was a stunt. Like a casual Saturday afternoon prank. And she just cited examples of other things she's done, it isn't the first time she was fake bloody or anything, but seriously.mit was unreal. But them we just got on with whatever we were doing.Seriously though, weird example of ""that escalated quickly"" because I had been in that dream for a while and then boom terrifying and then boom jk it's okay.

Take something that would not show you shallow, but has some good reason behind of it.  For example,since rich people do not tend to wear synthetic fiber and only wear natural fabric, you decided to do the same, but you give a reason doing it for as an environmental and ecological reason.   Also you should not discard your cloth quickly, but wear it to death, and make sure they are well tended for as well.  Using of dryer is not adivisable, therefore.  "

They wouldn't hold prejudices or expectations about you, negative OR positive. "

ISFJ,"I do think in general, ISFJs have a desire to get appreciation and validation from other people.  I know that everyone likes this to a degree, but I've noticed a lot of T types don't seem to have much of a need for it, and view it as a weakness.  Even Fi users seem to be more independent and don't rely on others as much for their self-image.  It almost seems like for other types, confidence issues come from within. "
INTJ,"EDIT, for informational purposes: Without the lighter I have also found Pam will kill nats via direct contact.

About 60% of the time I write something on PerC (if I really do care about/am interested in what I'm writing), I put quite a bit of effort into the design of the post because I want it to explain something as clearly, correctly, and precisely as possible. It's kind of satisfying when an INTJ post describes some strange dynamic I have always experienced but not yet been able to put into words. And the connotation of a word, by definition, is not the same as its meaning in the NT forums. On NF, for example, I might consider it because I know the optimal meaning will be based more on connotation. I don't know how many INTJ's adjust in this way."

Lastly, however, is our youngest--also a lefty, and my poor wife bangs her head against the wall trying to teach her simple arithmetic. I think it's more a righty-lefty thing than personality type.    Oh?  Ok, that's interesting, cause on the forums from what I see I think ISFPs seem to have a reputation for being bad at maths, and that isn't the case with me, so I was wondering.  I think out attention to detail can actually help things...  You seem to blame a lot on being left-handed."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by TheWaffle   Saw this question on an ISTJ thread and thought it was interesting. If you were another person, would you befriend yourself?    I would definitely befriend myself, given I would still have some similarities between the me now and the me in this hypothetical situation. You need to be able to befriend yourself in order to completely understand yourself. There are times where I laugh at and mock something I did which I later thought was ridiculous. I suppose this is sort of how I would act if I were another person and befriended myself.

The heartbreak was intense and I would settle for good over great any day. Because with great comes also pain from the absence of a person. An incompleteness when away. A dependency on another. A trust that I lack. Everything that has gone deep into my heart has blown up in a nuclear explosion my whole life. Unfortunately my destiny is not to find love. Instead I connect with thoughts.

INTP,"I have kind of been talking to another girl at work, well, have been for a bit. For some reason this one is way easier to talk to, she has got to be an extravert. I have not tried to type her yet (probably on the to-do list), as I don't work directly with her and don't interact with her that much. It feels a bit more comfortable around her too, then the other girl (the introvert). Anyway, we have been talking, ended up showing her a photo I shot of a massive downpour a couple weeks ago and she wanted a print. So I thought it was a good opportunity to give her a link to my gallery, so I said, ""I will text you the link, whats your phone number?"" No hesitation, but the phone decided to choke and she did not get the link. Well, I printed up a couple photos to hand out to a couple people, including her, but it took me a couple days to run into her. Tonight when I did, the interaction went good, she even joked around with me a bit because I was soaked from doing something. She really dug the photo. I did give her a written link to my gallery this time and said if there was anything there that she wanted a copy of, to let me know. I thought about inviting her out on a chase but was unable to and I guess that is fine. I really don't want another situation with her like I am with the other girl."

How old are you? Didn't you learn by now you shouldn't believe everything you hear...especially if it's written on the internet.  I've read about ENFJs that when they are younger they are not necessary going to be popular and can be quite withdrawn until they grow up.

My friend said that they were like many other couples at our school who were privately dating and refusing to acknowledge a relationship.

I really was never pressured to have sex while in school by anyone, but I was also not in any close relationships during that time by my own choice.

ESTP,"Takes me a while. A good 3-6 months tbh. But the original attraction has to be there. Some sort of appeal and chemistry is an absolute must. Then friendship, talking and getting to know before the infatuation really hits me ... but when it does, it hits like a ton of bricks and I can become downright obsessive. "

ESTP,"Also, two biggest tantrums or some such of last year's, one was due to failing to reach a goal for such a long time and me getting impatient, the special thing was only that I was suddenly wondering in the middle of the rage as to when I would finally feel like stopping and getting out of it. A bit surreal, that feeling/wondering, haha. The other one was due to having a friend picking on me really bad and unfairly out of the blue, I didn't want to show anything to anyone, though, so that wasn't really a tantrum in this sense, just raging silently by going out and exerting myself physically to release it somehow. (I didn't call out on her about it because I didn't want to show hurt)"
INFP,"I'm not suicidal. I'm not in pain. Instead I'm starting to develop a sincere hatred for the world and everything and everyone within, including my own body. A part of me wants to see things burn and people in pain. In some twisted sense, it smells of justice."

ISFP,"Another thought, though I don't know if such things exist where you are, or if it is possible to get much work this way these days, would be temp work. Again, things have probably changed, but when I did temp work, I was frequently offered a job full-time because I did really good work. I worked hard and conscientiously. It's a hard way into the door, but from what I've seen, people who go that route aren't quickly set aside if and when the layoffs come. Unfortunately, I don't know if this is still the case--I did this 20 years ago. One other thing I would consider is learning something like HTML and CSS, and Python, etc. and start learning how to code web pages--by hand, and with free software, and take up designing sites for people. I like doing graphic design--like with fonts, graphic elements, page layout, etc. In fact, if you had the software (I think one can get Adobe Creative Design 2 for free now), you could do page layout for people who are publishing for themselves--like on Amazon, etc. It seems to becoming more popular, and some people would rather pay somebody a hundred or two dollars for doing that messy part for them. Just do your homework, learn the ropes, and make a bunch of mockups yourself. In fact, you could try writing a novel--or better, a bunch of short stories, and publish them yourself on Amazon or some such, just for the practice and experience. These are just ideas that have crossed my mind for myself, imagining if I were in a similar situation. Unfortunately, except for night watchman, the others start off slow until you build yourself a reputation, but a good reputation, once built, can be the source of future work or success. But that only requires doing your absolute best, integrity and conscientiousness, which don't cost money, but can be hard, at times to hold to."

And i think she's got less remorse about it than the housemate who moved out last year due to her abusive roommate. Though if she did move out and continue to pay rent, than that would be pretty sweet. Kind of like getting our cake and eating it too. Because we would be paying as much as if 4 people were staying here but everyone would get their own room. Oh and I thought about it and decided that she has no real excuse to move out.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by maust   I just use an excessive amount of emoticons and hope people don't think I'm a crazed lunatic. That probably won't work once I lose my youthful charm though.    Or add a ""haha"" or a ""lol"" at the end to soften it."
INTP,"ive been to asia before. i'd say asian people are quite suitable with INTP's, for the large part they just mind their own business. you could wear stilts and a pink wig and not feel like anyone is looking or judging you, which is very different to western countries (well, the UK, as thats where my experience comes from)"
INTP,"African's are starving to death and we are stuffing our faces, and genetically altering our food to make it as unhealthy as humanly possible... it makes me really sad.    I'd say it's that and the lack of self-control and moderation. There's also the problem of kids being brainwashed into liking these foods. Parents are setting back examples by frequently taking their children to these fast food restaurants. And don't get started on the use of toys to lure in children."
INFJ,Originally Posted by Ava82   I don't think it's mandatory to distinguish between thoughts and feelings in this post ;)    Is there actually a difference between the two for you INFJ lot?
ESTP,I can't see my way to doing that. I don't think I could function that way.
ENFJ,It was just 5 days ago my brother told me that since I've left my nephew has been falling sick regularly. That he misses me all the time and has started asking about his Aunt [my ex] as well and apparently has started refusing to eat regularly. The kid is showing signs of abandonment - and I ... 
ENTJ,"The LOTR series whether novels or movies, sits in my top ten of all time."
INTJ,"On the other hand, he's not exactly perceived as a hero in the beginning."
ISFJ,SO debate? NOPE (but it might be due to the fact that I'm a nine...)    Probably because of being a 9 and because of having bad experiences.  Everyone appreciates being heard and having divine interested in their thoughts.  Perhaps you just need some better luck with the debate partner component :)

ISTJ,Sitting in the library all alone and sipping an expresso. Kind of disappointed that my research this weekend didn't turn over as much as I'd hoped. I'm going to have to spend extra hours at Starbucks over a cup of tea organizing my notes and thoughts on the research so I can present something to the boss come Monday morning. Wednesday morning is when our response to the other side's pleadings are due. I haven't figured out whether there WILL be a D-Day in which the allied forces (my firm) will get a shot at storming the beaches of Normandy. The enemies (opposing side) surely won't give us an easy shot.    What kind of tea do you drink at Sbux?
ENTJ,"Ha. ENTJs and money. My understanding of money: When I have enough I don't need it more. In fact spending seems to be quite an exhausting job itself. I also do things for no profit without thinking about it. Luxury stuff: unnecessary. Over polishing makes things uninteresting and bland. F*ck you Mac, welcome glorious Linux and command line."

ISFP,"But this is only true on the surface. She refers to herself as a geisha, skirting about social interactions and activities with an adorable childlike naivety; innate, unassuming acceptance; and confident and cool sashay that an Se auxiliary provides. Yet I know in her quite moments she can be full of doubt and fear. I want nothing more to be there for her during these times, but I'm not sure how. She's resilient in taking care of her issues on her own (a concept foreign to me), but when she's let me in, I haven't been able to help her in the way I feel she wants. I'm a people-problem solver, and my directive approach to her issues only seems to reinforce that she keep them to herself. Any tips?      Originally Posted by ferroequinologist   he he he... ;-)"

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by eve91   I think your sister is probably tired of trying to get the love and affection of everyone and not being appreciated for it. The thing about ESFJs is that when we do something we expect something in return (I know it sounds selfish). By something we do not mean the same act done for us, but rather love. Any act that shows love, it may be so small but it would mean the world to us to see that the other person cares. If we realize that they don't and if we close off completely we end up being that (critical, etc). I have a very bad habit of being like that with my younger sister, we just don't get along. I know its bad but at times I feel like I can't help it."
INTP,Lalalalala...don't think don't think don't think...

Once you've ripped the CD to your PC (or media device) it's no less convenient than the digital download - sometimes moreso because of less pesky DRM. I also enjoy having my music ripped at a higher quality which coupled with my great quality headphones makes things sound super nice~. Me being pedantic though, obviously "

Slowly, the wall of sound weakened, and finally died out. They were spilling out of the plane doors now: people of all sorts, walking with a strange gait and unblinking eyes."

ISFJ,"Debating can be much fun as long as the other person is open to different points of view, and is not afraid of the whole thing either. I have an ISFJ friend who would never get into debates, because she finds the very act of debating pointless - she's like ""Why can't they just agree on something? What's the point of going on and on and on?"" And then she gets super mad and just withdraws from the whole situation to calm down. I'm the complete opposite though."
ISFP,"I don't think I believe in gods and demons and so on, per se. I think I do believe in karmic energy, and the idea that if you focus on the good or bad, you welcome good or bad things into your life."

ISTJ,Although I didn't take my own advice lol work on it in parts/sections until it's done  that way it won't seem like you have a crapload to do in such a short period of time. ; )
ISFJ,If anything I am slightly jealous of the male friend he currently lives with who easily gets quality time with him (and may not want quite so much of it). I wonder if there is someone he lets in when stressed and get a little bit jealous of that person who may not even exist.

Highly insane society, like ours, will pay to watch her hurt herself and them. "

ISTJ,"- My second line of thought isn't so locally-oriented.  In other words, ""lawful"" authority could have various meanings.

And then it goes back to normal, I forget the awkwardness, try again, and get uncomfortable moment with same person again. But sometimes, I'll just stop, so there's really no reason for the mask.  But because of such events, the mask becomes well I don't want to be placed in a vulnerable position like that again, so I disregard my feelings."

She thinks that I don't know who I am REALLY and that I'm not TRUE to myself because I base my assumptions off a sober me. Which leads to her talking about how she prefers to talk with me when I'm drunk.    Hehe, ya i've had similar conversations. Usually they say stuff when I have been drinking, because apparently it is not normal for someone to remember everything that happens when they have been drinking."

ISFJ,"I constantly forgive someone and constantly invite them into my life. Whenever we argue... I remember why I always let them go.

I wasn't trying to disparage the sport in any way, and I would agree with you that my feelings of boredom are largely because I don't understand what sort of strategies are being employed on the field. I don't think it's easy at all, but when any sport is played at the professional level it can seem boring, like a pitcher's duel as I mentioned. I suppose I'm just with the majority of Americans, we somehow don't ""get it."""

ISFP,"I also love some unusual things, like futurology (one of my favourite website is futuretimeline). That sort of goes hand in hand with my views about society...

It's understanding the needs and wants of everyone and everything in your current situation, including yourself. It is honesty. It's knowing you're possibly wrong. It's openness to a new idea. It's admitting your weaknesses and your faults. It's responsibility. It's discussing things in a civil manner and considering all points and perspectives, and trying to reach a common goal or idea, or agree to disagree. It's thinking, rather than acting on things with a whim. Consideration. You're upset and want to fuck off or procrastinate? Think about it before you do something stupid. Come up with new methods or solutions to change your path and pave a better future method. Be smart, be crafty. Don't blame others, and don't be a martyr or victim."
ENTJ,"I've got about two glasses of absinthe left, half a bottle of whiskey, and a bottle of chardonnay someone left with me (I'm a Chianti drinker, but I won't waste booze--if I don't like it, I'll spike it with the whiskey ), and a fridge full of beer.  I don't plan to drink all of that, but the supply will certainly be diminished.  (I think the whiskey wants to go first)    Loved this movie. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:We had two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon."

ENFJ,I hate it when I'm stressed and can't properly articulate what it is that's even bothering me. Sometimes I just don't friggin know! But it's there. And it's a legitimate stress factor.

ISFP,"Helping is also a comfort zone for me. It's a way for me to feel connected to people without having to express myself, which I'm usually anxious about doing. I don't have to worry about whether or not someone likes my personality, even though I still want to socialize, because all I have to do is help them be the best version of themselves when they'll let me. It just feels more black & white/concrete than exchanging opinions and HOPING I won't offend them by having different thoughts and beliefs. I'm fine only sharing those things with close friends, but I'm not fine with not having a way to interact with the rest of the world. "
ENFJ,"I absolutely agree with you: everyone should live their life in a way that makes them happiest and they should, therefore, have more faith in themselves. But it seems like the people that matter to me don't take me seriously. Maybe it's because I'm a teenager and am surrounded by teenagers who are put under different peer pressures to me (I make it a point to not feel like I have to dress prettily and that I don't have to have a boyfriend to seem important) and to me it seems like even though I try to see their many-faceted personalities and person-hoods, they don't do that in return.

It's the same thing with Christian, should I stop being a good Christian because there are misconceptions of what a good Christian actually is? Something else that causes how the non-believer see us is the whole ""squeaky wheel gets the attention."" It's the Christians who make these absurd agendas supposedly based on the Bible that get the non-believers attention.

ISFJ,"Me: ... why haven't you taken it in? Found out if there is a rescue center that could help it with veterinarian care? Built it a shelter? Adopted it? It's fairly tame, right?

ENFJ,"What promises can I make - when there's very little hope left that I'll be able to fulfil them. What am I really worth? Not just in the eyes of those close to me, but in my own eyes? I'm trying my hardest to get out there again and do something for myself ... but to only walk for a few hours before coming crashing down in pain and being hobbled like a cripple for two days after is a prospect too scary to bear - and a burden too heavy for others to bear.

ENFP,2) I talk to EVERYONE. I need to. I draw my energy    I very much agree !!!
ENFP,"Why? Because you're breaking the pattern of how you've been acting. It will draw so much more attention than you trying. I can tell your intentions are good and from how I've interacted with you, you seem like a genuinely caring person. It'll work out eventually, and if it doesn't, then all the better for not having someone like that in your life because whatever used to be there is gone. (Heh, Te is a bitch.)    Thanks for the reply. Sounds like you know what your talking about. At this point thats all I really can do haha. Ill take your advice and if they still hate me...oh well, what can you do right? Wouldnt be the first or the last"
ENFJ,"I want to make this all your fault, but I've never been good at such things. Instead I'll say that both of us together simply did not work, not that you are worthless, or I am worthless....but that we'd simply be worth more to someone else."

Don't worry, typically ENTPs don't aaactually take themselves seriously enough to believe they're ""above"" anyone (unless they really, really hate them).  The arrogant front (ex: my last comment on the thread) is just for entertainment purposes.  In fact, we tend to think highly of people who pick up on the joke.  In a lot of cases, the a-hole front (haha, taken literally, that's a weird image) is sort of like a test to see if the other person has a sense of humor.  It's probably not the most accurate test in that not everyone thinks radical schtick is funny (so the person tested may have a sense of humor in spite of not getting the joke), but when someone gets our sense of humor, we can at least tell that they don't take things too seriously and that they're on our same wavelength."

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Tripwire_Desire   He pulled a classic ""bait and switch"" on you.  Whether he did so intentionally or not, that's the million dollar question.  Either way, it says something about his character.  It's my humble opinion that a true ISFJ believes in equivalent exchange; if one doesn't exist, he/she will create one on the spot.  It's also my humble opinion that a true ISFJ's word is their bond; it's their stance on integrity that dictates how they conduct themselves afterwards.  If this guy truly is an ISFJ, he set the bar for other ISFJs on it's lowest setting.  I'd be careful about him if I were you."

ISFJ,"I would imagine ENTP's strengths would be their flexibility, creativity, and being able to see things from multiple angles.

It's literally like something fell out of the sky spontaneously and landed in your brain and now all of sudden you get an ""a-ha! moment,"" where it all makes sense. Meanwhile, you're still wondering and trying to figure out, why these ""a-ha moments"" take place and how they randomly just seem to occur. Personally, I think it has a lot to do with how in-tune you are with your surroundings and how intuitive/observant you are. Your brain probably does this so naturally as a Ni dominant, that it's most likely second nature, without you even realizing it sometimes. It's when we become ""more aware"" that we are doing it, that makes us second guess what is going on. It's like this undercurrent antenna that picks up signals and patterns, which then interprets and translates accordingly, in order to guide you in the right direction.    That's exactly what i've been experiencing most of my life."

INTJ,"I know what you mean here and have been in similar situations, I just tell them to fuck off and leave me alone. I'm content with myself and what I want within my life. Just because my ideologies do not correspond with their ideologies doesn't mean that something is wrong with me or that I'm lazy. I just happen to actually think about these things and find alternatives that better fit my personality and my way of thinking, therefore I choose a different path. When you challenge people, or defend your own way of thinking I should say, you start to realize how deeply rooted this type of thinking is ingrained within society. It's illustrated in false dichotomies, or dualistic thinking, or a type of quid pro quo, which happens to be the basis or foundation of how the Protestant work ethic is formed. Things like, ""Well, that's the way it is, you could be on the street homeless, be lucky you have a job in this economy."" Choices are thus minimized into a very limited scope or perspective, which negates and fails to challenge the current paradigm and if anything it continues to breed a paradigm that is outdated.

ENTJ,"It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather ""nonviolently"" in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: ""The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason."""

INFP,"Originally Posted by Euphoric Nocturne   I am reminded of a time when I was about 10 or 11 years old. I was in middle school and there was this girl in my class. She seemed like a shy girl before. Later on in the school year, we would start conversing along with some other classmates. Then we would occasionally tease each other in a somewhat playful manner (I would say you're so-and-so"" and she would say ""oh yeah? well you're ...) it would go on like that. I didn't think much of it. A friend of hers had told me that she had liked me. I was in shock and disbelief since no one had ever shown interest in me. I was in so much disbelief that I started laughing hysterically because I couldn't believe it. I know that wouldn't be the most appropriate of actions. I we never talked after that since she had a different homeroom the year after. I really regret that happened even though I was just a kid, I was immature and I don't think I could've handled that. I wish I could have told her that I was very flattered to know that, because I was (and I still am), but that I regret to tell her that I didn't have those kind of feelings for her. When I think about it, I just wasn't mature enough, I couldn't have returned those feelings because it was so alien to me, I've never gone through such a thing, and I reacted poorly. She may have felt bad about it nonetheless, maybe something could have developed. But I think she was only attracted to the outgoing part of me. I would remember that a year later, I notice that she was looking at me from a distance. She had a look on her face, I now realize what kind of look that was. It was the very expression I make myself nowadays. It was a look of longing, a look of sorrow and hurt. I definitely knew I hurt her in some way. I feel nothing but regret about that. I could not have returned those feelings at the time, but I wish I could have put it in a better way. I just hope I could meet her on the street and just say ""I'm sorry"". Maybe that's why I feel unworthy myself. That since I've hurt someone, I needed to know what that felt like myself. Maybe this is my punishment. This is my lesson. I don't think I ever want to hurt someone that way ever again. Either I've learned my lesson and I should try to find someone because I'm tired of waiting. Or I still have much to learn, and crash and burn in my search and attempts. Maybe I'm trying so hard to redeem myself by helping others, making work easier for others, by using the gifts given to me to entertain others, using what I know and what I have experienced to make people feel that they are not alone, because some of the most powerful feelings I've felt were to feel that I am all alone, and to be proven otherwise. I guess it takes pain for me to become enlightened. Ow, I just had that ""screwdriver-in-my-stomach"" feeling. I just made myself feel much worse now :(    Ok, it's a little late to quote this, but I just wanted to say that your story just resonated really deeply in me.

As well as a life time, of trying to understand people, and the world. Both in an intensive quest to in some way understand myself and conquer whatever demons remain in me to be the type of person I want to be. I think that making a decision based sole on emotion is a truly bad way to make decisions. I also think that no decision is ever made using thinking. Thinking only disqualifies options it does not produce them. (One of the reasons feelers are so much more positive about things and people. They create stuff, and often get cynical and set in their ways when someone says that it isn't of merit. They often then become thinkers or alienate themselves from criticism, with an attitude of you can't say my feelings aren't right because you can't truly prove anythings not right.) Feeling and the subconscious are interlinked, they create things, (By create I in no way mean actually create from nothingness I mean re-shape.) give explanations and connect the dots. Reason points out when something is wrong, that's the conscious' gift to humanity. I identify myself as INFP not because the tests tell me so, it's because I relate holy and completely in my core values and beliefs with what is important to them. My interest in people makes me an INFP, my obsession with mastering myself, questioning myself, and treating the world with an even minded compassion. The INFP is the epitome of a person who seeks honor in their person and does their best in the world for every one they can. I was born an INFP, I grew up an INFP, I adapted to life. Now I always, and I mean always make sure to see if whatever crazy crap my brain comes up with is thoroughly tested by reason. I think everyone else should as well, in order to allow their creativity to take it's full and ultimate shape. "

ENFP,"Often, showing sympathy and giving advice puts both the giver and givee in an emotionally vulnerable spot. As an ENFP, actually, as a person, I don't like putting my emotions out there for them to be ridiculed or trampled on. Engaging in a conversation with someone who might choose to poke ""sarcastic fun"" at what I'm sharing might make me reluctant. Someone who isn't very in tune with feelings in general might make sarcastic jokes as a coping mechanism, because they are uncomfortable sharing their feelings. "

I may freeze a little in response to a barrage of expectations, or pull away, 'cause ewwww, but it's not like I panic because I don't know what I feel. I always know what I feel, I just don't consider it relevant in certain ways.

ISTJ,The Spanish again were the colonial overlords of the people of South America. The Spanish were embroiled in European affairs almost entirely from the foundation of the colonies to the time the colonies broke away. The colonies basically governered themselves with little to no interference from Madrid. Despite the presecne of some Spanish troops there was not much government control. By the time the Bourborn dyansty was installed on the Spanish throne and the colonies stayed on. The Bourborn dynasty fought against Napoleon and eventually lost anyways. The Spanish king went into exile and when Napolen was defeated and he sought to reclaim his throne he appealed for help from the colonies. So now the situation was reveresed. The colonies represented a lawful form of government for the locals while Spain represented nothing not even a proper working government. So the rebellion if it could be called such was more like a war between two foreign powers since the lawful government was at home.

I can't not explore my emotions for long. I have to feel all that I feel somewhere sometime. Nothing may be stuffed down or forgotten permanently, until it has been taken into account, until the future is predicted. Just wait till I can stand it. As each song comes up new perspective comes to me, first I cried, then I relaxed, now I'm happy, these songs help me organize all that is in me; to give up, to separate. My private secretary. If I can feel each of the songs as they come then I know nothing's wrong, I know that if I can truly apply each one to an aspect of my life that all is in balance, if every note makes my heart soar then I am content. If nothing rails against me, then it's ok. Can I make it through each of them? So far all good though not without effect."

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ravenlove   These are great questions. If I am overspending, I see it in the ledger and have to change my habits.   In relationships I can be very flexible and accommodating to another. This quality of swaying to flex to another persons demands is what perpetuates demise in overtly unbalanced relationship. (So you probably say, why do this then?   Innate wiring?  IDK.).  In this case things have to get ""very bad"" before I do anything about it. I am a thin person, and I left a position only after I lost 15 pounds becoming dangerously very thin and having problems sleeping from the stress as well as problems getting up from the lack of sleep.  I felt committed to my job. So in this case my health had to take a substantial decline before I intervened.  The biggest reasons for delay in action are twofold.  First, when I am posed with a huge decision such as a position change/ big confrontation my mind becomes bogged, almost paralyzed for action.  Second, when my mind is struggling with a morally charged issue such as a commitment, my ""feeling"" is so strong my action to confront/act/change also becomes paralyzed, because I am using so much energy just dealing with the emotions involved.  Oh how I envy those that function by logic and facts!! It seems so much easier...so much clearer.   This is where my logical friends' support is gold.  These insights have all been pointed out by others in my life helping me to see what I couldn't see. Thank God we are all different and that we have caring supportive peeps to help us out.

They can also get stuckin doing their routine business and they would rather postpone or not go to a social gathering then delay what they are doing. You shouldn't go for things that you don't want to...and I guess it's an ENFJ thing to suffer so much when people do this. I think I just lost 2 relationships with 2 people I really liked the past week(s), yeah, it sucks but life goes on. I can't imagine having a problem with a close family member, they accept me as I am and I as they are, even if we are very different. Maybe you should try that, be good just when you feel strong enough to, without expecting anything in return and when you can't, just say you can't do that."

Married/taken 20-30 year olds? Definitely not. They all seem to think that the simple act of befriending me will make their partner instantly leave them. xP    Not my experience at all, but I think a lot depends on who you socialise with-- I'm mostly hanging out with people who self define as expats (I like to call myself an immigrant to fuck with the white westerners-are-expats assumption), so there's some stepping outside your comfort zone involved already. And I'm pretty openly nonmomogamous, so you'd think I'd be viewed as more of a threat. So far the response has been overwhelmingly positive, although I've got to say I didn't come out to the church people I used to associate with when I sang in a gospel choir. "

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ultraviolxnce   I think I really need to go into therapy, because I can't seem to control my emotions, like at all. One day I could be perfectly normal, but by the next day I'm super depressed and wanting life to end. For the past two years, my life has been a constant rollercoaster, and I've sought help from friends, but I think my constant need for reassurance is what is keeping me on this rollercoaster ride. The more I ask my friends, the more I think about the problems that I have. This is probably super confusing, so I'm sorry about that. I'm just scared that one day I just won't be able to shake myself out of the depression like I used to be able too.    It makes perfect sense to me. I have experienced something similar, perhaps on a less intense scale but same frequency. I stopped sharing so much with various friends because 1) it didn't help much usually and 2) I think I knew all along that something needed to change in my life but I didn't know how or what, and I kept expecting others to tell me what it was. If you think it would help to go to a therapist, you could do that and see if anything is clearer. The state of mind you're in when you ask for help has a big impact on if you make a change or not as well. *shrug* I still struggle with knowing myself and understanding when to ask for advice and when to just seek out solutions on my own."

ISFJ,"3. My mother and I have had similar problems with sleep, but she as a mother and ISFP will worry about everything that she can possibly think of to worry about, especially her family. Her mind won't shut off, her thoughts keep going. Usually, she gets terrible sleep and her sleep schedule isn't consistent. She's had this problem for at least a couple of decades. There's always something for her to preoccupy herself with when she would otherwise be falling to sleep. I'm convinced that it's genetic, because both of my parents are worriers and I'm a worrier. My dad's anxiety is much more under the surface, he doesn't discuss it, but it shows when there are matters of money that arise, and his ability to provide and financially be prepared, and issues of health.

ISFJ,"For instance, I have some extrovert cousins who are very into, or at least follow, politics. I don't really. But I love listening to them talk about the facts, the pros and cons of this issue or that candidate, both at the national and local levels. However, I also have an introverted friend (I have no idea what any of their actual personality types are) who has some strong personal opinions on political issues. I agree with her about them and like hearing what is currently going on with that issue. But since we have already chosen our sides of those issues and have told each other our stances, I really don't want to discuss our personal opinions anymore. It's draining for me and covering old territory without any reason to do so. This is different from conversations with my cousins because my cousins present new information and, while they may tie it back to information we knew before and describe its development to the present, the conversation with them is about the new information and not the old."

NO-ONE GETS IT! it's weird, but I can be feeling slightly upset about something, and I'll be talking to my friends, and I'll be screaming for some help, dropping hints everywhere that I'm not feeling good... and they just don't pick up on it! Stuff that would have had me knowing something was up about 2 hours ago! It normally takes my friends a couple of weeks to notice that I'm not being me.... I just wish I had an ENFJ friend! =P"
ISFP,I also haven't posted on PerC in a while probably out of lethargy or general apathy. Maybe I can get back into the swing of things...

I only just became interested them yesterday... was buying dvds online and stumbled across one of theirs, looked them up to see what they were about... pretty cool.  I'm not sure I'll buy dvds... but I might look into seeing if they're playing anywhere near by this summer.  I wouldn't mind going to a show.  "

I don't feel like someone who naturally has a good hold on my emotions; I'm certainly not ruled by them, I'm just not as emotionless as most people seem to think INTJs are. However, I don't really value my Feeler side very much, because I know how not being objective can lead you into trouble."
ISFP,I have read multiple books on dating and listened to geeks guide to dating audio book more than 3 times and the conclusion that I keep coming to is I have no chance in hell and I still don't understand or figure out how to end the 33 year single streak without ending my life.

That's the whole plan of the evening, to sit around and get drunk. Maybe I'm just getting tired of empty cans of beer and four loko sitting around the kitchen.

ISFP,"I guess talk of sin doesn't bother me because to me sinners is just another word FOR humans: sin to me is a curse we have to bear: sin is human nature; it's inherited, we try our best, we can't help most of it without help; it's the great equalizer, a weakness in us that should make us compassionate towards each other: call it what you like -- making a mistake, sinning, 'fucking up' -- it's all the same to me and it's all hard on us. Talk of sin doesn't make my blood boil because I know that recognizing it is halfway to accepting the only help and safety from it. So yeah, they're pretty much interchangeable in my mind, the words sinner and human, but I still mean either of them just like you mean it when you say human: just an imperfect person with their own set of peaks and valleys, someone who's looking for something and who just wants to be loved, ultimately, and who should be loved, and who is loved, and who wants to love in return, although many don't know it or don't know how."

If I am acting irrational in this thread, I must be made rational. If people see ghosts, that isn't rational. It must be rationalized. We assume that rational things are the ONLY things that can exist. And that statement does turn into Ti. Things dont happen because of causes, they happen because of reasons. Because reality is rational. Irrational things cannot exist in it. Which is proven wrong by our very existence. We are irrational beings who insist the universe is rational.    Being rational and rationalizing are not the same thing. We can say that all rational thought is rational to the subject, and therefore rational thought is subjective, and by that logic we can say everybody is a Ti user. "

I was even holding off paying other bills right now just because we are so strapped for cash and now this hits. And of course since I work out of town, I'll need to rent a car for this weekend all the way through at least next weekend, depending on how long the repairs take, which is even more money I don't have, and because I'm sure they will have it repaired before Wednesday, I'm going to be responsible for all the remaining days before I get back into town for the rental."

I come from a family of intuitors, so a lot might be just having to deal with it early... So I guess ESFP?    Well understanding the culture of a new place might be a struggle for an Fi type in general because we don't tend to look at social stuff all that much. But still it's interesting.

Though I think that our top two functions are more under our conscious control than the bottom two. Sometimes when I get a strong feeling to do something and it doesn't make sense, I do it anyway. It always explains itself later. My take on it is because I saw something through unconscious Se, and my Ni just told me to do it without explaining why.

Sometimes a group will be talking about something for a while and I feel a bit guilty because I realize I am totally responsible simply by placing a pointed question and getting everyone to talk about this one topic I wanted to talk about.

While practically everyone is on their phones during class, I typically am not, but my friend got caught on her phone in class, and got her phone taken away from the teacher who is usually very laid back and friendly. However, he seemed extremely annoyed and semi-angry. I felt really bad for my friend, who is a very good student and a hard worker, but I also felt bad for the teacher, because everyone disrespects him. In addition, that was one class I was also on my phone, and although I didn't get caught, I felt extremelyyyy bad and guilty afterwards for being rude by using it. I still feel awful. "

ISFJ,"Hard to keep up with their level of energy sometimes though, haha    Sounds like the two of you are a good match.  Currently I don't have much energy, so that's not a problem."
ENFP,Alas we will never know... I'm still in favor of Hiddleston taking a personality test for Loki. 
INFP,"I think that everyone has his own way to get happy, and you are the only one who is able to make yourself happy, its all inside you, you just gotta discover."
ESTP,"How Ni really works for me is that a difficult concept or puzzle that can't be figured out easily takes time to work itself out in the subconscious. I've consistently noted this as a repeating theme in my life. Can't figure something out immediately, sleep on it. The answer will come the next day. "
INFP,"Sometimes, you make a choice so big that there is no going back. I hope you don't try to. I don't care that you've changed.  What you did was too big to ever make amends. I hope you don't try to, because I don't want to feel guilty for rejecting you. You rejected me first and I deserve so much better. In fact, I do have what you were not to me..so you better not try to establish a relationship with me. I am at peace living my life knowing nothing about you."
ISFP,"There are some instances of ""meanness"" that I don't judge harshly when it is derived from personal pain like a young street preacher guy who I saw screaming at everyone about being impure and how they would burn in hell. I felt sorry for him because I could feel his personal hell. However, people who are sadistic receive my full judgment and the ones who killed my friend's son, I wish they were dead. They thought it was funny."
ENFJ,"One of my good friends hates me irrationally, I'm going through a super stressful time at school, I'm having a mild identity crisis, and I haven't gotten to interact with my friends as much as I feel the need to (to the point where I feel like I'm starving the relationship), but I manage to keep a good mood by looking forward to something coming out of this that is better than I can imagine."
INTJ,"Sometimes I'll organize a snack on my plate -- cheese on cracker followed by a bit of apple, repeat -- so I don't have to think about what I'm eating or the order I'm eating it while I'm reading.    I organise sweets by colour and perceived tastiness and leave the best until last.  Sometimes I count each colour and create sweet charts and patterns."
ISFP,"I'm kicking myself off because I can't do meaningful, productive things, not because I can."
ISTJ,Wal-Mart and other similar places have similar prices and similar merchandise.

INFP,"I truly despise any sort of -ism, but with the mexican immigration dispute and the portrait painted by the majority of news (it's somewhat waned from what it used to be), I honestly due notice that people might and in all reality at times dismiss me due to my ethnicity (polish mexican, and strange combination in my eyes).

This made me think of how sometimes I wish that I were be able to cry  more often, myself, though I certainly wouldn't want to every day  either. Or, maybe in my case it's more that I wish I could cry for  myself sometimes, rather than always for other people. I hope you're feeling better soon, anyway. :\"

INTJ,"Say it's social phobia.  I had a brief stint of this in my teens after a trauma.  I would break the trip to town into several easy trips rewarding myself with praise or distracting myself with a book.  I would make it to say park 1.  Sit down for a while, people watch from the safety of a book, or actually read the book. Then to bus stop two. Sit for another brief stint do the same.....etc."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by That Iam   Hello ENTJs. This is my first time blogging about anything. I need help getting an entj girlfriend back who has dumped me without explanation.    If there was no explanation, then it's probably something that neither of you can change."
ENFP,"Im not sure what you mean by marriage. I dont think that one should sign paper and claim that they're married, and I love my partner just not his entire family . But I do believe that you could be with the same true love for the rest of your life. Ive been with my ESTP partner for 9 years, married  for 3. When he proposed to me 4 years ago, I didn't freak out, i smiled and said "" Why engage when we've been married for 5 years already."" He wanted kids and believe that in order to have kids we need to be married , i give in bc his wanting of marriage is more important than my not wanting marriage .Until this day, i refer my husband as my other half or best friend or lifetime boyfriend because the word husband weirds me out, in fact i never call him my husband. However, I have no fear of commitments if that's your question.    Hey! I just asked this! lol XD"
ENFJ,"I miss home. I miss warmth, love and family. I miss snow and hot chocolate. I miss comfort. I want to wake up and feel warm, and full of love for life, myself, my family and the world."
ESFP,Having to prove yourself and your intellect and having to learn constantly
INFJ,"I have done it a few times, but maybe you haven't noticed."
INTJ,I look for my rather intelligent ESFJ friend to challenge me and pressure me into doing work; can't work without pressure or competition.

ESTJ,"I like console games like Bioshock, the many Arkham games, L.A. Noire.. played a load of FPS back in the day. I play loads of Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing and the like on my 3DS.

ESFP,"1.  My brother is very emotionally stable, but he had a lot of discipline in his youth.  Our parents were strict and traditional in that way.  On the other hand, my ex-boyfriend had virtually no discipline starting at age 13.  It was all sex, drugs and alcohol, experiencing life without consequences.  My ex uses legal drugs now prescribed by his shrink like dex, antidepressants.  These drugs supposedly are supposed to keep him emotionally stable, but his life is far from stable at times."

ISTP,"That moment when you're excited and showing enthusiasm, and the other person says ""Wow chill"". What a buzz-kill. "
ISFP,Maybe He will punish us people when we died and we didn't do His command in this world.
ENFP,"I would think so, the enfps I know and I am. We're not shy for the most part, we can be quiet or loud, calm or bubbly...but when it comes to talking or motivating others , I dont think ENFPs would feel uncomfortable, in fact we're one of the few types that enjoys talking as much as we enjoy listening to others, so public speaking would be easy for us because we have intuition on knowing what the audience wants to hear, and we have passion to share our ideas and motivate others. Samuel Clemen(Mark Twain) would be a good example of an ENFP"
INFJ,"The book I was reading that contained this powerful poem stated, ""An open heart looks outward.  A closed heart looks inward.  Open hearts create energy.  Closed hearts deplete energy.  An open heart isn't really as much  a matter of time as it is a matter of being present, available, and open to whomever is in my physical space at any given moment."""
INTP,"Sometimes, listening to bad pop music can be made more bearable by imagining the singers as horny chimps."
INFJ,"I like chocolate, I like chocolate more than people. Chocolate is delicious and cannot talk back. Plus it has caffeine, yummy caffeine."
ENTJ,"The point of being a friend isn't that they supersede value, it's that I can trust any interaction with them to be valuable. For instance someone who I can have a good conversation with or can count on."
ENFJ,Today I felt like a little child who got nervous calling a cab. 
ESTJ,"this is new to me.    New to me as well...      Originally Posted by kept81213   Its very easy to hold a grudge against any personality type. I know I for one have.

My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. "
ENTJ,"You mean the story of the rich yuppy who paid a lot of money to play at being a farmer and spent all day watching real fishermen nearly die to catch her organic wild-caught dinner on the flat-screen TV from her oh so cute rustic style kitchen? I agree!    You've misread my post, I'm lamenting the position of the common man. I'm well and truly working class, born and raised in poverty, and working my way out of it. I'm also living in a ridiculous housing market, hence comparing with others. "
ENFJ,"Its...kinda hard being an ENFJ in a small town filled with ignorance and spite. I am turning 20 in June and the last ""meaningful"" relationship I had was when I was 13 and it only lasted a month. I try so hard to find a deep chick with who I can express my true self, but all I seem to find are silly little girls who can't make up their minds. Quite frankly, Pigeon Forge, Tn is a terrible place. I feel too reserved at times. Today, for example, I woke up finding myself completely depressed. By the afternoon I was energetic, happy, quick on my feet, and charming as ever. But, as the evening approached, after having spent the day with an old high school crush, I was lethargic and careless. At times I agree, ignorance is bliss, but in this case, its quite the opposite. Finding a genuinely interesting girl in this town has proven itself to be damn near impossible. This place is a dream burner. Relentless it seems."
ISFJ,"One of my colleagues is a ISFJ. She's nice and helpful in nature, but maybe because we report to the same boss, I can sense her competitiveness. "
ENTP,Originally Posted by _Observer_   It is true but not funny. I feel for single xNTx who cannot find their matches.
INTP,"Well, as sudden as it could have been, anyway. She had 184k miles, and had picked up a few other little ailments along the way."
ESTP,Even sending a gif or picture that we might like or that pertains to us in some way.
ESFJ,"Originally Posted by deviantcode   Zombies are gay. And intp do care about others wellbeing. They just won't demonstrate It as much. So it appears as if they don't care. Especially if someone requires excessive emotional support.     Yes they do, but don't ESFJs do it more?"
ISTP,Originally Posted by cotillion   you sure?    Lmao NOT ANYMORE.
ESFJ,"No fears, ESFJ here!!!!   I am fairly new to this site and did not even know my personality type until last week when my husband suggested that I take a test to find out.  The first test I took said I was an ESTJ, however after some self reflection and 3 more tests I found out that I am actually an ESFJ.  Three out of four test had the same conclusion.  My husband is an INTJ and has become very interested in all of this personality typing stuff.  So I decided to try per c out in hopes that I could relate to him better and learn some things about myself and other personality types.  So good, so far:)  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.  We are not all too busy with our ""extrovertedness"" to have some intellectual conversation from time to time:)"

ENFP,"That answer, however, is for the present me.  A few years ago I started seeing myself as hideous and it made me hate being called cute because I suspected it was a lie every time.  I didn't want to leave my room.  I didn't like interacting with people.  I felt resigned to life as a bitter, lonely person.  And then I saw myself in the mirror with better lighting and thought, ""Damn!  I'm beautiful!""  I suspect it was an unconscious coping mechanism, but it helped me keep going even with intermittent bouts of believing myself ugly.  Then I grew up a bit more and realized I have worth beyond my appearance.  And now I am where I am in the prior paragraph."
ENFP,Originally Posted by Chris Samberg   I would probably say that the easiest way to offend me would be to say that you don't like me.

ENFP,"Oh, absolutely. I struggle with this in a lot of ways. Sometimes I don't want to let a topic drop, but other times I'm afraid to even bring one up or contribute because I know I'll talk about it for too long. I've been told so many times to shut up or that I never stop talking that it's become a huge insecurity of mine that produces a lot of contradictory behavior. xD"
ESTP,So I just tried to find a statistic or whatever I can hold on to.    Find the pattern in his behavior instead of adding extra components into the soup. MBTI is a good servant but a bad master.
INTJ,"2. You can't see their brains, only their tits and yeah, figure it out..."
ESTP,"One of my hobbies will be going to clubs and bars to read people and observe their actions, actions speak louder than words. Its funny to observe and predict the next step and so. Yes, I read people (trying all the time). But I can't seem to read INFJs they hide too well and are too reserve and slow.    Interesting ... what do you then do with the information you have read about them? Do you use it to your advantage?"
ENFJ,"I'll tell you about my feelings. though. I dropped a course from an INFJ prof. But now I feel bad because I talked to the guy and gave him my name. Knowing how sensitive INFJs are, I don't want him to feel rejected or disowned; I almost wanna go apologize for dropping his course, which would surely just make him annoyed at me. If only I could register for again, that would make me feel better about it, but I can't. I feel like a jerk."
ISTJ,-Selfish people who don't care about others around them.

INFJ,"In the waiting room at the doctor's I was reading an article about J.M. Coetzee. Then a lady came in and she started to comment on the weather.

I went to a psychiatrist who disagreed with that assessment.

INTJ,"The INTJ I know tries hard to put across an image of being heartless, making people think she just doesn't care about anything.

With lots of words in it... words that mean the same thing as other words.  She:  I know what a thesaurus is, jackass.  Me:  You phrased the word 'thesaurus' as a question.  She:  That's not what I meant.  Me:  I know what you meant. She:  You're just being a jackass.  Me:  I just want my list.  And be original.  She:  If I have time, I'll see what I can do.  "

ESFP,And they just never apologise for havin not listened / not trustin me all that time. It really is upsetting.
ISFJ,"ISFJ friend started ignoring me in conversations last night. I noticed she just broke off mid-convo and started organizing the room, strangely. I have an extremely perplexing, frustrating, personally heart-breaking situation going on in my life. ISFJ friend has been as supportive as she could. However, she wants me to make decisions I am not comfortable making as she believes it's the right thing for me to do. I just don't feel the same, and now she thinks I am too stubborn. I probably seem crazy to her as I can't concretely explain why I've made my choices, but I feel like she is judging me for it. I feel like she is not entirely on my side, because she is siding with the authorities (eg. If so many people above are against you, maybe there really is something wrong with you)."
INFJ,I have to log off for a super long time now till this awkwardness wears off ... 
ESFJ,do not mean anything so I tend to second guess using them.

ENTJ,FIRE AWAY !!!    Do you guys think that one day maybe one of you guys would fall in love with one of us? I don't know what you would see in an INFP.. but I like you guys. My ex is an ENTJ but I think he only likes me still because he doesn't want to be lonely or he misses being in a relationship... I asked him recently what he admires about me.. and at first he couldn't say anything. Eventually he said I was caring. Is there anything you guys like about INFP?

And further more, trust me on this one, you do not want somebody who cannot accept you for who you are, you will end up even more hurt (I know this from experience). They will just try to change you to fit their view of how somebody should be and that will make you feel insecure, miserable and unhappy with yourself and life. If somebody likes you great, keep that person close, if not, that's cool, let them be and move on, there are a few billion people on this world and all so different, you cannot be liked/accepted by all.

Besides an INTP couldn't have beared all the logical mistakes we did in our work.

Also, my dad is ENFP and my mom was INTP(possibly INFP) and things like creativity/humor/questioning things were always encouraged growing up, so I've always wondered how much that affected me as an Si dom. I was wondering if it would be more likely for ISFJ males to mistype as INTP or come across that way. I've heard that a lot about INFJ males, but not much about ISFJ males. "

By many accounts, it's 98.7% backed with the remaining 1.3% the result of linguistic ambiguities. If there's one thing I've learned this past year, it's that man's law is hardly ever set in stone. It changes arbitrarily with the times. Sometimes, a previously sacred ruling gets overturned based on one judge's whim or another legislature's backpedaling. But such isn't the case with the Bible. It's withstood anvil of time nicely and continues to do so. No higher court on Earth has ever overruled a holding in any of the books."

As far as the enneagram/MBT combo goes rest assured that it is plausible (and is also probably why you are a little confused). However, if you want to find out your Myers Briggs type it would be best not to mention your enneagram type until after they've typed you. When I don't tell people my Myers Briggs they say I'm 5w4, when I don't tell them my enneagram they say I'm ESFP, but when I tell them ether I'm something else entirely (let's face it, people are incapable of not being biased).

He also isn't known for being the one to initiate lengthy conversation, usually letting people come to him, however with him and I he almost ALWAYS was the one to initiate conversation before I could get a chance to and often chose standing and talking with me as oppose to his other friends even though our conversations often weren't about much in particular. My friend (who has known him for about 6-7 years) says that she's pretty positive he has a soft spot for me, and even she suspected he had a thing for me, so we were both a bit surprised to find him deny having any significant feelings for me past friendship.

To our knowledge, no previous studies have tested for possible relationships between sociosexuality and male preferences for feminine women. Nor have any studies tested for possible relationships between sociosexuality and preferences for sexual dimorphism among homosexual individuals. Men with increased masculinity and women with increased femininity tend to report less restricted sexual behavior than those with decreased sexual dimorphism (Boothroyd et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2005)."

ESTJ,"@Pinina  said he was 17, and I'd assumed he was in his 20s so I'm curious. I know I come off a lot older online than I actually am."
INFP,"There is a movie I advise every INxP to see: Into The Wild. It's amazing! It is about (I believe) an  INxP that leaves everything behind and goes to live in nature, and truly enjoys (as only INxP's can!) true beauty of nature and amazing beauty of every moment."
ISTJ,"Besides...he didn't seem to be aware how nice I was being to him.    IMNSHO, his ego was fueled by his MBTI designation. I will not miss him."
ISFJ,* I used to be super sensitive to criticism and still am in some ways 
INFP,"One is crippled without the other, emotion and reason. Emotionless reason is what a computer or robot can do perfectly. That's the one end of the scale, the other is the religious zealot, the madman, the fool, the child that refuses to grow up. One does nothing but eliminate possibilities, the other does nothing but make connections. Everything can be connected, in a million different ways, it's reasons job to eliminate the connections that do us no good. That do not stand up to the rules of the world we live in, that is how I define each. The only truly optimized members of society are the ones who realize this. It's a process of trying to gain the best of both world's. A truly rational person is never truly right because they never venture anything only tear down. They never ever prove themselves right only prove that others are wrong."
INTP,Sigh... the Rockies got absolutely stomped this year.
ENFP,"I have a ENFP friend who i have known since elementary school and we are both 18 now.but i avoided her few years back because she wanted to be like me and is kinda creepy. but recently she contact me again and ask me to teach her how to play DOTA. knowing that she is not a gamer girl and onli played runescape and maple before and quit after entering middle school, i knew that she deep down have some hidden motives.Furthermore she onli have a macbook, no windows. I played DOTA onli with BOTS to try out but im more active in LoL. however games like dis are just my second entertainment, my first entertainment are anime and manga onli. i cant help to think that she wanted to learn dota with hidden motives. she have nvr seen a real game unlike me, i have a brother who played DOTA so sometime i went over and watch his games. she came over to played DOTA on my laptop and wow she played like a runescape gameplay. even worse den me when im alr a hopeless noob."
INFJ,"I also recommend only listening to one at a time, because listening to all videos at once will mess with your head O:"
ISFJ,"But, I do see myself as traditional in the sense that I create my own sort of mini-traditions, that probably aren't often recognized as traditions by many others. Like eating a certain food while watching a TV show or something, and then I'll always associate that particular food with watching that TV show in the environment I first did that, and then I'll continue to do that because it's a connection to the past. At the same time I'm so focused on that type of tradition that I can create negative ones by accident, like if I remember a certain taste or smell from a really bad time, I'll avoid that smell/taste in the future because it'll remind me of that time. That's one of the main things that leads me to think Si and ISFJ over INFJ. "
ISFP,"I always think I understand something until I go and try to explain it. All of a sudden it's like, what happened? I knew it a minute ago!"
INTJ,"Do you guys start thinking on random topics only when you're alone (or have retreated into yourself), or does it happen all the time? (You have inferior Se, so... yeah.)    I can be in my head whether I am physically alone or not. I can think up random topics while in the middle of a conversation about something else.

ISTJ,EDIT:  I did forget to mention I do have flooding problems in the downstairs laundry....although that actually has nothing to do with the building...and everything to do with the council and their changing of the storm water drains system.  My house is across the road from another cul de sac which runs downhill and meets conveniently at the point of my sloping downward drive.
ENTJ,What is science and math but an extremely simplified system that explains all phenomenon and just requires the memorization of some formulas?

INFP,people in this world. It's amazing the amount of energy they waste.
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by joe_the_buckeye   Is there a gentle way to let down an ISFJ girl who's made it clear to me in her own quiet and kind way (implicitly, not explicitly) that she doesn't look at me as just a friend? My dilemma: if I'm direct, she'll feel hurt and embarrassed...if I'm indirect, she'll feel rejected. I don't want to distance her, but I don't want to accelerate something either until I have some clarity - because if I do and ultimately things didn't work out, she'll be borderline heartbroken. Professional advice for an emotionally-clumsy ISTJ fella?    Do you know why you aren't interested? Cause she's going to want to know. Whether she asks or not, there is always that ""what's wrong with me?"" thing that circles in your brain as a girl. I wouldn't tell her unless she has the balls to ask, but I would definitely figure out what the answer would be. She may not ask for YEARS. But, it could happen. That out of the way, you're going to have to tell her. Being direct doesn't mean you have to be a dick. But being forward is something she'll appreciate later. Something like ""so, I'm really glad we're friends and I don't want anything to make that stop, but I feel like you may have deeper feeling for me. I don't have those feelings for you. I'm sorry. But I would like if we could still be friends."" She'll kind of explode. Internally or at you... all depends on her maturity. You can follow up with, ""i'm sorry. I understand if you're upset. If you want to take some time and calm down, I'd be more than happy to talk to you about it after. I do still value you as a friend after all."" And then give her some space. Check on her from time to time. If after a couple months she's still telling you to get bent, well... you really don't need gems like that in your life. And who knows. She may just take a deep breath and be cool with it right then and there. But I can't stress enough how important it is for you to tell her. The longer you let her think there is something possible, the longer her brain works through 500 ""what if"" scenarios all at once and on repeat, the longer she doesn't know which way is up... the more she'll think you're a dick and the more she'll wish that you just respected her enough to tell her. She's an isfj and she likes you. She's going to be hurt. But if you show her you care about that, she'll forgive you."
ISTP,"I'm beginning to wonder if she's an ENFJ or something, since she's so damned ditzy. She's definitely not introverted or logical whatsoever."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by petals of stone   Zeth, you have too many problems.....    Oh no, even my logical side tells me outright that I'm overblowing these problems way outta proportion."
ISFJ,"She does this with almost everything, but what drives me really crazy is when she procrastinates with paying bills. It isn't like she has trouble paying them, she just doesn't get around to it until they are almost late, late, or someone threatens to send her to collections. "
ISFJ,I've always felt that ESTP's and ISFJ's complement each other well. I have a lot of time for ESTP's!

For the last part.. well, I'm there with her when she's upset about things (sometimes). When I'm not, she often phones me for advice. But then when I ask if she's feeling better the next day, she says ""fine now"" and changes the subject, then in front of others, she might claim that she never ever cries.

ENFJ,"I appreciate your honesty. I know what I need to do in order to save myself, it's just getting the balls to do it."
ENFP,"I watch cartoons. Yes. You read right.

Always tellling a story and always in such an enthusiastic way that you think it's going to change the century, even if she just tells you about her co-worker having a new date. Some people call her drama. She does turn little things into huuuuge stories.  She would be a good entertainer or comedian. She's also quite straightforward and honest.  I love her :) I guess ENFP in comprison are a bit less ""high on emotion"" and like to discuss more abstract topics than ESFPs."
ISTJ,"I've been able to keep the flinching to a minimum.    NIC card is another one that drives me up the wall.  Once a person says something like NIC card, I don't hear anything else after that.

It isn't so much hiding myself, but showing the aspect of my persona / interests that will fit best with my current surroundings. Now on the rare moment that I am truly out of my element then I strongly question why the hell I am there and likely won't repeat the mistake."

Tried counseling but, the therapist want to eventually have private sessions with him (stated he was the issue after couples ones) Of course, that went over like a lead balloon.  I went back one time after for her.  Lasted a month.  He has tried even 8 years later to reconcile...Not happening.  He is charming when he is working an angle.  A petulant child when he does not get his way/results he wanted to the point he takes it out on her.  Disappearing with no contact months at a time.  Fuck that."

But I also don't have an appetite for anything. Which is weird, because I've always been quite decadent about food (and look the part)."

I reached out and told him that I care.  I think I love him, though I have never said it, I told him that I care deeply about him.  Even knowing all of the shit, his flaws and asshole tendencies.

ENFJ,"I feel like I can Rant about my excited feelings here. So I'm moving out and I'm so damn happy about it, but I feel bad because I can tell that my mom is going to miss me she was like how am I going to deal with things, I'll guess I'll just have to write them down, because the majority of the time I'm the one she rants everything to. That aspect makes me a bit bummed, but she'll still see me. The people I'm moving in with though seem pretty awesome and I hope that they like me, the one girl posted on one of my facebook status' and said with that mentality you'll fit right in, the status was That no matter how hard your night is a hot bath and a glass of wine fixes everything. It just made me feel good, like maybe I'll have a chance at being able to hang out with people and have some fun again. I'm just Dang excited."
ISFP,"when I took the quiz the first time it showed that I am an ISFP but I kept repeating it over and over again and it showed only INTP !! can you imagine? I thought I was an INTP for like 1 year ! then I started to figure out my S power which is pretty obvious and I knew that I am an ISFP because I have the talent to draw, like really good and perfect drawing and since then I kept drawing and drawing until I reached where I am today.    Being able to draw doesn't make you an ISFP."

INTJ,"I was really hurt in a past relationship. I brought some of that shame and guilt to our friendship. Maybe having outburst in conversations that were close to my heart, or not taking into consideration that our friendship can't be compared to past experiences. I made you angry, said things i didn't mean. I have trust issues, not necessarily with you, although i take all this issues out on you.  You get fed up with me and walk away from the friendship, rightfully so. So now the door is slammed. "
INTJ,"I've found that engaging my Se by immerging myself in sensorial activities is a great way to release stress. It can be cooking, or a hot bath with incense, soft music and good wine, or mindlessly drawing/painting without a picture in mind, just feeling/listening to the pencil or brush slides on the paper and playing with shapes and colors, or taking a walk and paying as much attention as possible to my surroundings... just anything that requires me to pay more attention to my senses than to my thoughts."
ISTP,"Quite frankly ISTP and INFJ aren't too far off, especially in a more mentally developed character like Luther. Do you remember where he said he spent his childhood reading books, writing, and chasing girls while his father wanted him to play sports (or something along those lines)? I think that would be more indicative of INFJ, although that would be employing stereotypes."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Rebecca.M   Not the fake, obnoxious clean linen fragrances of modern laundry detergents either... the simple, old clean linen.    The way I would put it is that ENTJ emotions are usually forthright and genuine unless in a loop or otherwise troubled. We say how we see things, no emotional overload. I usually have several emotional filters on and let resurface only those I consider relevant to the situation and reasonable, all others are brushed off (I dislike dealing with the whole spectrum anyway). Strangely enough, my Fe-dom friends seem to appreciate this a lot. I guess dealing with indirect people can be especially tiring to them."
ENFJ,Hope to do great things... looking for perhaps first major large scale commercial achievement. Perhaps there'll be a large banner promoting a product that was my idea before the end of the year... or a TV commercial scripted by me... looking forward to it...

INTP,"And then the more practical question, would saying that cause people to tell you that you're arrogant, whether you are or not?    Arrogant? No, but definitely pathetic.

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Cassieopeia   I'm always feeling passionately; I'm always in extremes. I usually feel an extreme contentment. Does that even make sense? A contradiction but I feel it. I usually feel in the moment how lucky I am to be here, alive, seeing, hearing, breathing, feeling. I just feel like my whole life has the emotion and melodrama of a movie. It feels silly, but I think I have stories that could make a good one. I wanna write a book, but I don't quite know where to begin. I feel oh so vulnerable whenever I write and share it, but it feels good, because people tell me that I inspire them, and that's what I live for. It really is. I almost feel like the seemingly horrible health problems I've had were meant to happen to make me a better person. I don't necessarily believe in predestination, but it sure seems meaningful. I stay positive about it all now; it's the only way to get through. The challenges I've had in hospitals, when I look back on them, I think of it like: ""I got through that. I can get through anything life throws at me."" I think of it like: ""If it weren't for that happening, I wouldn't appreciate every little aspect of my life the way I do now, even the parts that most people find mundane."" I think of it like: ""I know what it's like better than anyone: to have hospitals as my second home. My doctors saved my life time and time again, and I'm going to return the favor back to the world. I'm going to become a doctor and provide children and families with the greatest empathy."" My body is still struggling, but I know what I can do. I can use my mind and my heart in a career. I can and will be a pediatric cardiologist. I'm not going to stop trying. I won't.    Wow, I simply had to reply to this. It's so full of life, it is amazing. If I were you, I'd embrace my contradictions and live life the way you want (which I'm sure you are), it's just I see such energy for life in this post, I'd hate for the 'contradictions' to hold you back. Contradictions are meant to exist, otherwise they would not, just like you. Have a great day. :)"

ISFP,"IMO, comparing the SP temperament to the NF one in this way would _really_ help you pin down the INFP type, because, honestly, despite how similar ISFP and INFP are in many ways, when viewed through the lens that he offers, there just is no way, for instance, that I'm a guardian nor a rational (though I would like to be one) and especially not an idealist, even the Healer (INFP) idealist. "
ESFJ,You know you're ESFJ when you have nightmares about cockroaches crawling all over the pile of dirty dishes in the sink.
INFJ,"Man, that thread has quite grown since the last time I saw it. It's probably one of the best places for ""the dark side"" of INFJs, though I've only read a couple of beginning pages, so bear that in mind."
ENTP,"Go into the forest, plug your ears, I will hit you in the side "
ESFJ,"Yes I often want human interaction because I get very lonely. I'm content to spend some time by myself, but eventually I'll get very bored and lonely. Eventually I feel like what's the point in doing anything completely alone, and it's not fun because there's no one to share it with. A normal day I'm at home and I never leave, not that I enjoy it but I just never have any transportation or money to do anything else. In spite of my efforts, I'm still waiting to be hired for a job. I do chores, I play games, I talk with my mother, I give our dog some affection, I try to get up my courage to take on some responsibilities that daunt me emotionally like contacting Collection Agencies and checking my email and applying for more jobs."
INFP,"I'm pretty sure this forum as turned me into this sappy/romantic being -___- , damn you all! I swear I wasn't like this before... I had always wanted to be in a couple but it had never crossed my mind all of the sweet things couples can do together."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by siljeth   It's ok it was all just a badly worded question followed by a misunderstanding haha. Thank you for the answer anyway! I haven't really typed many people in my life yet, but I do know about one ENTJ that I don't know personally, who is really nice, only with a tendency not to care if people are offended by his humour sometimes. I have an INTJ sister and internet friend, and they are both fluffballs, so I don't really have any prejudices towards T's. I know their emotions, but they prioritise logic in most cases.    We do that sometimes. *sheepish* Younger ENTJs also just tend not to notice it- the Fi only really kicks in during the teenage years, and doesn't fully settle in until later. Before that we can be a bit blunt, just because we haven't learned quite how others react to us yet, and why we might want them to react more positively."
INFJ,"I mean, she's always been needy, but now she is more dependent on people. She always need to be around them."
INTJ,"You have to find the 15% and be thankful that there are that many who are decent enough to converse with. These people will know they fit into that 15%.    I think it is even less than 15.  But I totally agree.  And the percent that I want to hang out with is a fraction of that.  I am usually just working my ass off to mentally keep the numbers above zero, zero being I give up.  But zero isn't too bad.  What's worse is when I start letting them in for amusement.  Then I get into the minuses, and that's really dark and bitter * grabs bug and pulls off leg *"
INTP,"So, the RNC had Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair."
INTJ,"@Biliana  : we're aware of it, and we don't care. Not because we're insensitive, but because when someone ask a question to INTJs in the INTJ-subforum, we expect them to know about the way INTJs handle things and abide by it. Seems like simple logic."
ISFP,"And lastly, if it's something I don't care about at all, I just let her win. Too lazy/not enough energy to actually argue about every trivial thing. She's quite religious whereas I'm not so when she tells me stuff that I don't necessarily agree with, I just go, ""Oh, okay"". "

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Ravenetta   Yeah, I've had a somewhat messed up life. I've had a lot of sexual rejection in serious relationships, my mother has some mental off-balance, possibly mental illness with paranoia and thought my father was evil and told us rather horrible tales about it, so I grew up thinking he hated me and my family. I've always identified with her deeply because she's ISFP and sweet and loving, but have recently learned her reality was completely distorted and I believed many lies. I've also been on the receiving end of alot of dismissal in my life. It's easier to just feel like I'm not worth that much, so that the dismissal makes sense. When I feel self-worth, then I have to deal with the reality of why my romantic partners, my mother, and others managed to hurt me so terribly. I want to think well of them, so it's all very complicated."

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by teddy564339   Ha ha...with toothpaste, I wouldn't say I feel bad, but I do tend to get every little bit out of it.

For me, it's because I like holding onto that tube!  I didn't realize this until you just said that!"
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by teddy564339   So if I had to guess, I would say she's nervous and wants you to like her (even if it's not romantically), but is afraid that you won't if she's different than you.  She probably thinks that if she's like you, you're like her more...so she's doing what you do.    This sounds exactly like her. Today, she apologised to me for not being nerdy enough because I made a nerdy joke that I had to explain (something I'm used to). I told her that I like her for who she is regardless of her nerdiness. That seemed to cheer her up, at least judging from texts.      Originally Posted by teddy564339   This may be especially true since you're an ENTJ, which is a type that I think tends to intimidate ISFJs, as I'll talk about below.

I'm not sure if that's the right word.      Originally Posted by teddy564339   In addition, ISFJs can be very emotionally dependent sometimes.  I know what makes me happier than anything else is working hard to do something for someone, knowing that they need it, and having them show appreciation for me for doing it.  I've found that NTJs don't enjoy doing this.  They're very independent people who want to solve their own problems, and they want others to solve their own too.  They don't like the idea of someone being dependent on them for appreciation, especially emotional and verbal forms of appreciation.    I would say that this depends. NTJs are still people and we have different needs and expectations. Personally, I like this and, again, this sounds like her. She brought me a cake made by her every weekend for the past 2 months save one time when another girl and me were kinda sorta flirting together. She started fighting for my attention and the following weekend didn't bring me any cake. XD That was when I realised there might be something more to it than just her being nice. However, every time she brought me some, I was always very grateful and then she brought more next time. The last time this happened, I had 4 pieces of 2 cakes packed for me on Sunday morning. XD She's such a sweetheart."

ESTP,"In what way does meditating helps you understand how you're feeling? Being a thinking type as opposed to feeling, I assume that ESTP's arent' always in touch with how they feel so I assume you would need something or someone to help you clarify what you are feeling.    Meditation helps not just to chill and relax, it actually helps to look to your innerself to your soul we do that in Yoga. I know for thinking types we generally use logic over feeling but as you grow older and experience with the world and other people, some might help you to develop the other functions. I think this is how I get in touch of my feelings a bit more. I remember when I was a child... I thought I don't have much feelings. I think I am the coldest person in the family. Now I like to look at things from both logic and feeling side, who knows, that might be more accurate? There are plenty rooms of improvement for the functions."
ISFJ,"Usually, when I get off work, that's when I think about the deaths that has occurred that day. Today is another kind of hell for me because I know the people who died.

ISFJ,"The beginning is kind of blurry now, but something was going in for poor people on TV or something and then they asked for people to out all of their waffles out by their front doors. We had 3 huge boxes of waffles, so I put them between the doors. Then I was running water, which came out of the hood over the stove straight into the pot and turned on and off with the twisty knobs that usually adjust heat of the stove and when I tried to turn the water off, it kept running, so the pot was getting really full. So I stacked pots under it so it was directly under where the water was coming out and somehow that controlled it, didn't matter that the pot was full. Then I went back into the living room and opened one door to see of the waffles were still there and heard a voice coming from a megaphone, the dude was saying he had no clue where he was. Then I saw a guy walking with a gun in front of this crazy red vehicle, which was apparently police, walking towards this house on the street you turn onto my street from. All of a sudden these two guys come out, guns in hand, and start shooting at the ""cop"" who was wearing street clothes and looked like 18 and he backed up and shoot at them as well. The two shooting bad guys decided to split up, the skinny one running down my street, so the original cop guy started chasing him and another cop chased the fat assailant. I told my sister what was happening as she walked into the living room and told her to sit calmly and not look outside. She didn't get why I was worried, but I repeated that some dude who's been shooting at a cop is running down our street. So then up the bad guys got caught and my mom came into the living room and saw the boxes of waffles, which were getting soggy as they defrosted, and was like well nobody took them so let's put them away and wondered what was going on with the stove. Daniel's phone had been missing for days, so after we dealt with the food and kitchen we drove downtown to look for it, just me and my mom. We went into a building I assumed was a Mayo building (most of downtown Rochester is) and walked through several lobbies before getting to some dark police station apparently. We walked past a desk with a bunch of cops by it and they were all trash talking the dude who was driving the weird vehicle in my neighborhood, saying he was gonna get fired and they always knew he wouldn't make it. Then we went into a huge, dark lobby, and went to the end of it, where there were some cells. We walked to the end of the cells and my mom went into an open one and looked for the phone without any luck. As we got out of there and into the lobby, I saw a phone on the ground, but it wasn't Daniel's. I still didn't know why we were looking for his phone at this police place. We were on our hands and knees searching under all of the furniture for his phone"
ESTP,Agree to the doing things though. 3am and I'd probably be out skating if it wasn't raining.
INFP,"Originally Posted by faeriegal713   This is such a stupid thing for it to irritate me so much, but I HIGHLY dislike it when someone I'm talking to on the phone or at work or whatnot calls me ""hun"" ""sweetheart"" ""baby"" or whatever other pet names. You don't fucking know me. Just because I'm younger than you does not mean it is okay for you to treat me like a child. I hated it when I was called anything like that when I was a child, why in the hell is it okay now? I treat you with respect by saying your title or ma'am or sir or whatever, so please treat me with the same respect. I obviously had to work to get to where I am and I do not appreciate or tolerate being made to be less than you."

ENFJ,"Anyway, I'm not really here to talk about my childhood. I'm just trying to set some sort of foundation so that it can be easily understood where all my underlying anger comes from. I think that all of my subsequent anger is fueled by my repressed anger. I've done a lot to try to let go of all of my anger. I've written letters that I never planned to send, I've ranted venomously at times, I've tried looking at it from different perspectives, I've tried to attain enough of a peace of mind in order to forgive the people who have hurt me and I found that I can't. "
ISFJ,"teddy gave great advice. You have a lot of gifts that you can use in the classroom. Just remember that being a teacher doesn't only involve loving your content area and loving to talk about it for 45 minutes at a time. That's certainly a large chunk, but caring about your students as individuals (learning about them and their personalities, interests, struggles etc.), and being able to handle conflict and breakdowns diplomatically is the most important."

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Old Intern   Aside from a romantic partner, do you (I'm addressing any ENTJ's on the thread to jump in here) choose people to be in your inner circle, or do too many people already choose you to be in theirs? If you make a few closer friends on purpose, what is the criteria or trigger? I'm asking because I think most of my own relationships have been incidental, without being very satisfying, and I want to stop doing this. I've asked INTJ's and now looking for viewpoints from more extroverted NT's.    Many look up to me and invite me into their lives. SJs make for good aquaintenves but the only people that get personal with me are intuitives. "

We share a lot of traits such as the generosity and the general pleasure gained from seeing how we affect people's emotions. INFJ is more reserved and cautious about it, which can leave the ESTP open to exploit - however when the ESTP takes the hit, it's much easier to process and overcome."
ENFJ,"@mr. rozay , the strange thing was that I didn't even have a bad day. I don't know what triggered it. Actually, now that you mention it, I think it could be my response to stress. I guess it's what happens when I feel overwhelmed. I don't do well with transitions (haha), so driving all the way back here, on top of the constant thoughts of, ""Is my car going to break down? Will my dad be angry with me? His girlfriend probably hates me. What's going to happen when I get back? WHAT WAS THAT SOUND?! Am I going to run out of fuel? Do my tires sound ok? Where am I going to work? Do I have enough money on me?"" And I seriously felt like I was driving straight into that giant pile of worry and uncertainty. And the week before, I spent in a ""go go go"" mode. Talk to him, text her, drive here, try to keep crazy sister from being even crazier, etc. Pretty much just non-stop socializing. So I think that by the time I actually got into my car to drive up here, I was so emotionally exhausted that I just went into a trans-like state. Felt nothing, said nothing, thought nothing. And my, ""I don't give a fuck."" phase that I was in last night was like the first leg of my journey back to my natural self. However, now that I know more about Ni and what it actually is, I realize I feel/use it quite frequently. I was amazed when I looked it up and kept thinking, ""Holy shit! I do this!"" Lol. Thank you for your help! Sorry to bombard you with a novel of text."

INFP,"I'm thinking maybe I really am depressed.  All I feel like doing is eating, sleeping and masturbating to super disturbing BDSM porn about things that terrify me completely and relate to my own fucked-up experiences and fears, and even masturbating isn't fun anymore.  It's like something I am doing out of desperation because I can't feel anything else.  Eating only gets through to my feelings if it is something really bad for me that I wouldn't usually touch.  I feel like I am filling myself with darkness.  I am filling my mind, my crotch and my mouth with the vilest things I can find.  I haven't wanted to draw, paint, sew, or do anything meaningful for a few days now.  I don't think it is just because it has been raining the whole time, because I'm used to not getting any sunlight.  I think it is because I desperately miss feeling emotionally connected to someone, and after this long, I am withering away.  "

ENFP,You got this. :) I find doing so in question form helps when expressing my feelings to someone who may not feel the same..such as..
ISFJ,"When I was first trying to type my husband I had his type all wrong- mostly because he's quite unhealthy right now- and the type that I had for him at first really didn't have any success stories for relationships with my type. It was a bit depressing, but also confusing because we had a very decent marriage. Because of how quickly we got married and the fact that the only real-life person I knew who was into MBTI was my best friend with the ISTP boyfriend, I ruled out ISTP right away because an ISTP would never commit to anyone like that. And yet, that is exactly what my husband is and he never had a single issue or doubt about committing to me- unlike my previous ENTJ boyfriend. Type isn't everything."
ISFJ,"It's not to say I don't talk to people at all, because I do. I love talking with people, but I loathe the ""Are you excited for school to start?"" kind of stuff, because all I can really say is, ""Yeah, I'm pretty excited!"" Nobody's interested in my in-depth reasons behind wanting to go back to school, especially if they were only saying it to say hi in the first place. :)"
INFP,"My dad is awesome but he's such a nagging mother hen, it pisses me off. He needs to call me almost every day  and that's just so annoying. I know I should humour him but I usually find myself ignoring his calls. If I ignore them, he'll call like a dozen times (actually he called 18 fucking times today and texted 3 times) and then he'll call my brothers (who live in other cities) and get them to call me. He's actually threatened to move back here if I don't pick up. I've told him again and again and again not to call as much because, well, it's not like my life is that eventful and I'll just end up ignoring as usual. My mum can't persuade him to stop either. I know that he does it because he really, really cares and worries about me but ... yeah ... so annoying and useless."
ENFJ,"You are more introverted than extroverted. You are more intuitive than observant, you are more feeling based than thinking based, and you prefer to go with the flow rather than having a plan. Your type can best be summarized by the word ""Healer"", which belongs to the larger group of idealists. You have a capacity for caring that is deeper than most. You strive for unity, are fascinated by the battles between good and evil, and can be something of an idealist. Only 1% of the population shares your type."

ISFJ,"I was never dominant Introverted Thinking, and considering the possibilities via Extraverted iNtuition (Ne) wasn't accessible to me as readily as it is to an INTP. I basically resort to Ne when nothing else has worked. I go for the tried and true, refer to what's worked in the past, fall back on the familiar- that's my primary instinct. I like Ne, don't get me wrong- I enjoy it, but abstract thought isn't habitual for me. I think in concrete terms, about what's known, predictable, realistic. I work with abstract systems that have already been developed and need to be refined or challenged, I don't come up with much of anything ""new"" or ""innovative"" so much as I develop or support things that aren't yet mainstream but carry a lot of unacknowledged credibility."
INTJ,@FlaylexFayte  Not at all. Just felt like clarifying my point.

She left the house every Saturday morning at 8am for a coffee at a cafe nearby, followed by a visit to her masseuse and then a manicure.

ESFJ,"Coming from an ESFJ, I had a hard time saying no for the longest time until recently because of my relationship with an ex who was ISTP. I learned a lot from him and he taught me what I needed for myself and deserved in a relationship, which meant that I definitely needed to date an N person haha. I used to say ""Maybe"" as a way to avoid conflict of saying no and feeling bad. It's definitely something where we ESFJs need to work on our inferior Ti to think about what we want and what is and isnt appropriate in a situation. Funny story, I recently began using my Ti more and my INTJ and INTP friends were saying how if I relied on it too much I'd start to act like an INTP lol. I began to do that and they would yell at me and tell me to stop being that way, which is why I was so intrigued with your responses. They felt relatable in a way, but I see that I have to use my Ti in moderation to be balanced enough with my Fe dom. The ESFJ you were talking to probably was just unaware and more unhealthy if anything. Not all ESFJs are that way, and just need a motive to change their perspective so long as you word it in a way that we can understand. In my experience I found dating people is where I made my biggest changes and growth in life. It's interesting to see how you do it differently because it gives me a different perspective in the approach. It makes me want to learn more from you. :)"

I was really anxious about everything at the first half, many kinds of thoughts (everything but the exam) had raced in my mind, so that I couldn't properly concentrate on the exam at hand. (Combined with my record of not taking exams seriously, no matter how important they were, and my general disability to concentrate well on exercises,) I had to really push myself to focus. So, after going through a mini thought vortex (I don't know how else to describe it), I had calmed down a bit. Granted, I still couldn't put my 100% mind into it, as it is hard for me to make my brain work efficiently at a task at any given time (my thoughts just drift naturally). "

I usually feel in the moment how lucky I am to be here, alive, seeing, hearing, breathing, feeling. I just feel like my whole life has the emotion and melodrama of a movie. It feels silly, but I think I have stories that could make a good one. I wanna write a book, but I don't quite know where to begin. I feel oh so vulnerable whenever I write and share it, but it feels good, because people tell me that I inspire them, and that's what I live for. It really is. I almost feel like the seemingly horrible health problems I've had were meant to happen to make me a better person. I don't necessarily believe in predestination, but it sure seems meaningful. I stay positive about it all now; it's the only way to get through. The challenges I've had in hospitals, when I look back on them, I think of it like: ""I got through that. I can get through anything life throws at me."" I think of it like: ""If it weren't for that happening, I wouldn't appreciate every little aspect of my life the way I do now, even the parts that most people find mundane."" I think of it like: ""I know what it's like better than anyone: to have hospitals as my second home. My doctors saved my life time and time again, and I'm going to return the favor back to the world. I'm going to become a doctor and provide children and families with the greatest empathy."" My body is still struggling, but I know what I can do. I can use my mind and my heart in a career. I can and will be a pediatric cardiologist. I'm not going to stop trying. I won't."
ISFP,"@Crimson Ash  Hard to tell, really.

When I'm in a social mood, I'm highly receptive / responsive to external stimuli and I guess people (again, especially guys) misinterpret that spike in activity as me flirting since, ""Oh, the overly critical, mousy-ish *insert derogatory term for a female here* is being nice to me! That's unusual for her, she must love me."" No, stop that. Now I like you even less than I did before, lol."

IMO, an ENTJ should be ideally suited to this--so if she is not responding to this, then, IMO, it's possible that one or the other of you is mistyped, and thus, this tactic won't work. (For instance, and ENTP would totally mess me up, and an ENFJ would also get it wrong--at least partially. And the ENTJ method would mess up an ISFJ or INFJ, and even, to a lesser extent, and INFP.)"

To myself, I think I'm cool, weird, crazy, stupid, cute, and all kinds of stuff that I really wouldn't know how to phrase. In general, I guess it's just naturally easier to accept yourself than for other people to accept you. Hence, to avoid being completely alone in the world, a mask of personality sort of becomes a requirement, at least for me. There's a picture I found that got me thinking about all this kind of stuff, and that picture is below.    Not really. I feel like in general ESTPs don't really care about how others perceive them. Not to say that I don't want people to like me, but if they can't appreciate how awesome I am then fuck em."

I usually only talk about things I saw or that happened to me or stuff I like (tv shows, games, music, etc), I can't think of anything else to talk about. Is it because of the Sensing preference?

I often wish I was an endless bubbling fountain of fun topics, but I just can't do it, even if I really do want to talk to the person."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by DarkHurt   I don't think I can ever forget someone that meant a lot to me no matter what they've done. by the way, I appreciate the questions here , so what did you do to this ENFP friend of yours that you are asking these questions? maybe us ENFPs can help you a little better..    It's not really what I did to her as much as it is I deceived her. She's one of those people who has such a moral high ground and loves surrounding herself with people who are like her. I've been doing some shit I knew she wouldn't approve of so I never really told her. She always saw me as a saint. Someone got in between us and showed her an email I had written a long time ago to a friend of mine. It basically was the worst way I could ever say about all the things I've done. Like I made it sound worse than it already really was. She was my best friend and meant the world to me, honestly. I saw her the other day and I guess I just went back there; back to hoping things would go back to the way they were. We were at this reunion and she was nice to me. For the first time since all of that happened (about a year later) she treated me like anyone else, like an acquaintance. Which she never acted towards be that way before. It was always awkward and tense and her not being able to look at me. My friends say its progress, but my problem is is that I want more, and I'm not sure she'll ever tear down the walls. When I think about her past friendships they all have one thing in common; once they end that's it theres no going back. So what do you think?"
ENFP,:-P     I'm happy for you - see told you time will make everything better 
INFJ,It's been a day since I've talked to a certain group of people because I'm still irritated by their behavior yesterday and I feel like I could stop talking to them for a month if I wanted to.
ISTP,"So basically, I'm completely alone with thoughts I really don't want to have to deal with in addition to the three chapters and paper I have to read/write tonight.    Sorry to hear that, and I can imagine how it feels. I can take all kinds of shit as long as things are good at home, but if they aren't..."
ESTP,"Yup. IJ's blindspot is that their ways of doing (Si) and visions of consequences (Ni) can paralyse them as well as project that paralysis onto the doer. Openness is the key without worrying about being ""wrong"" as some sort of esteem issue. I don't mind being wrong when I'm wrong, but if I'm told to not even try, then I can get pretty cranky and abrasive.     The underlined and bolded is straight on point where conflict with my ex INFJ even my ex ISTP(maybe INTP) was!!!  Probably, just gas lighting on both ~anyway.  He acted like nothing I said or did was an issue until wayyyyy later.  It really pissed me off.  Don't be fake!  That is what I call it now.  I have since made it clear in any relationship(friends or potential others) I have~ Speak up right when something rubs you the wrong way or you did not like.  Address  it RIGHT then.  DO NOT throw it in my face a week later, two weeks later, a month or even a freakin year. It is like an unnecessary attack.  Who can correct something you do not like (if they want to) if they have no clue."

He likes to play music because it let's go of his ego, in the Freudian term. Naturally, I, as a Fi dom, can't help but interpret the letting go of the ego as actually coming close to yourself. I kindly and gently argued this possibility, and the thought of him coming closer to himself made him pale in the face."

ENFJ,"Today, it was stupid I know, but I threw two muffins into the garbage from what was left of a container of muffins my parents bought.  I have struggled with an eating disorder in the past, and my parents know about this.  I have also been rather depressed lately; it has caused me to drop half the classes in my schedule this semester.  My parents know full well about this as well.  My father has diabetes and my mother has put on a lot of weight recently; I threw the muffins away in order to prevent myself from binging on them, and also since I figured it'd be a waste for my parents to eat them anyway (frankly I feel that buying these muffins in the first place is a waste and that eating them only furthers the travesty).  When my dad came home just now and discovered what happened today, he barged into my room and raged at me, saying ""What is fucking wrong with you?"", telling me to stop ""doing fucking weird shit"" otherwise he would ""have me thrown out of the house and committed"" immediately (to some sort of mental institution supposedly; he always threatens to do this).  He then told me I had better not blow up about it and that I should let it sink in instead, and that he was yelling at me ""not to hurt my feelings, but to make me think"".

For promotional customers such as myself who get discounted pricing for only the first year, it's unlimited. It's not a problem for people living alone. But when the entire family is constantly streaming TV shows and movies, it's quite easy to hit the bandwidth caps. Once a person exceeds the cap, the company starts throttling your speed and/or charging fees for extra gigs of bandwidth consumed. "

Is a common ESFJ trait a tendency to be blind to people's faults and accept them as they are? I have dealt with a lot of being outcasted and misunderstood in my life (who hasn't) and make it a point to understand people and let them know they are accepted.    Completely agree. It can be a bad thing if I over-idealize them and become blind to their faults, but for the most part I recognize faults in people as a  part of them and show them that I accept them as an inclusive part of their whole character."

I get energy talking with people about ideas.  Socializing is like treading water, exhausting, excruciating.  As long as there is no socializing, I get recharged from people.    I have to say I don't even really get energy from talking to people about ideas. I can get lost in the moment and have a lovely sort of caffeine-esque rush of fun and interest - but I pay for it later. Boy, do I pay. So overall it is an energy deficit - but during it is similar to 'flow,' it can, when the company is good, be an engaging experience."

This always left me feeling second best because my Si is so low compared with hers - there was literally no way I could measure up to her standards.

You feel like if you take one without being told you can have one or without being asked then you're doing something wrong and you're unsure. You peek over at the trash to see if there are a bunch of wrappers and you only see one or two, so now you really don't know if you're supposed to take one. Finally after sitting there staring at them and feeling guilty for about 10 minutes, you decide you'll take one. And while you're eating it you're scared someone is going to walk into the room and be like ""what's wrong with you why are you eating that cookie, that's not yours!""    omg this is my life! Lmao"

Often I need several opinions to feel certain.  It's not that I distrust my feelings.  I trust my feelings for what they are.  It's my interpretations and analysis that I don't trust.  I don't trust my reasonings, but I need those reasonings to back up my feelings.  Make sense?"

ISTJ,"@jay_argh  - You do have some valid points, but again, remember that when we allow residual gender and racial stereotypes to persist and affect hiring decisions, that just becomes another step backward socially and culturally. It sends out the wrong message to business owners and joes alike. It ultimately leads to those who are denied access to the professional world having less faith in the system they should be having at least some level of trust--the government. If you don't believe me, think back to the race riots in France of 2005, the current ones in Britain, and the LA riots of the 1990s. The ones in Britain from what I hear were ignited from constant police abuse of black youths. But the one common denominator all three have in common is that all three riots involved a minority group with has historically always faced abnormally high levels of poverty and discrimination. Race riots in general are a rather unorganized way for group to express their dissatisfaction with the system. It really should come to no surprise that tensions were building up well before the actual riots commenced."

Those are our idealistic imaginations playing tricks on us. beware the mind hate you (that goes for everyone) and understand this sad fact i learned early in life, no one will ever, ever, ever be there for you until the end. for varying reasons, who knows when the end will happen for yourself or other. Be yourself, and you will be what you've always wanted to become. it's the hardest struggle there is for us in life, it sounds so simple, yet it's universal. Stop holding yourself back from your goals, i'm horrible at it, or amazing, depends on which way you look at it. As for people doing things for themselves, you'd be surprised how much help they needed a long the way, while intelligence doesn't guarantee success, we have to show it sometimes, as well as our talents, natural or learned, to be noticed in the world. we'll have to rely on ourselves to find love, the cliche love yourself to be able to love another, is cruelly true. yet it takes the love of another to show us how to love ourselves as we are unable to see ourselves from an outside source, not without some kind of serious focus and communication. both of which i lack under pressure. Try this, imagine how you wanted your life to turn out, on your deathbed, your last moments, pause that. who do you see around you, where are you at, how is everyone in your life doing because of you, now slowly go backwards on how it happens. and trace it all the way back to where you are now."

I drowned my ego (by which I mean self) in a sea of devotion and love for this person. I know she loved me in her way, but whether she admits it or not, she was using me the whole time, in multiple ways. She demanded monogamy of the sort that I wasn't even supposed to look at anybody else, yet she was smitten with someone else the whole time she was with me."
INTP,Dropping this acoustic down to D and raging around is very fun. Metal solves all problems
INTP,"Another possibility, which you suggested, is Fi and Ti. Both functions are almost parallel introverted processes, but to put it simply, Fi relies on relations and values more than Ti, while Ti relies on principles and logic. "

Its hard to counterfeit a dollar or create gold. It must be durable, relatively easy to transfer, ect."

All that getting older has done is allowed me to learn to be more diplomatic about it.  I could still stand to have a better poker face at times though when in the presence of foolish behavior.  I'm afraid my scorn is all-too-often quite evident."
ESTJ,"I have half a mind to report posts that are just badmouthing the type, because that's not what this thread is for, this thread is supposed to be informative. "
ISTJ,"Thanks.  TBH, I'd rather have a foot of snow than this ice."
ISFP,"Now, if you were expecting something specific about responding to your feelings--well, think of this. They just went away to a country where they will be for a while. Now is not the time for them to think about those things. Too much will be going on, so why bring up something that may end up awkward. There will be time to address that later. "
ESTJ,Prove your assertions before asking someone to disprove them.

ISFJ,I was just discussing this with another ISFJ friend of mine because it just happened to me 20 minutes ago:
INFP,"Somehow, I end up in a relationship with someone who claims to be an INTJ, but also has serious mental problems, including depression and anxiety. She is not just crazy, but legit batshit crazy. She is obsessed with tarot, astrology, black magic, stuff like that, but claims to be a rationalist/materialist. Seriously! She is insanely jealous and possessive, but I don't care and keep talking to other people and trying to arrange dates. I feel bad because I'm not giving her a real chance, so I end it pretty quickly. I never meant to agree to be in a relationship with her anyway, but somehow she swept me up into one. Tricky bitch. She was the one who helped me realize that I am androgyne, because she herself was transgender, so she could see my atypical genderedness, because that's her realm. I owe her a lot for that, at least."
ISFP,"I think it's really terrible for someone with an obsessive-compulsive racked brain to even bother indulging in media like this, especially when it's new and there's yet so much to explore and hypothesize. I can't seem to stick with one idea.. nothing is set for me. I may need to just drop personality theory all together and try not to reflect so much on it, but it's so intriguing and I can't let it go."
ISTJ,HA!    Touche.                                                                  
INTJ,Says one third. Its more than people think. Just like far more gamers are adults than teens.
ISTP,And that would also throw off everything I have coming off the nose of Swordfish.
INFJ,the skill to come across very skilled/gifted people who can do what I can't.
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Poetic_Anarchy   How easy is it to offend an ENFP?    I can't speak for all ENFPs, of course, but for me, I'm easily offended when I perceive that someone's purposefully attacking or criticizing something or someone I care about. I won't always speak up. I prefer to keep the peace. But if it's someone I know well, and I'm that passionate about it, I will fight them on it. But I usually avoid conflict like the plague. Conflict makes me feel icky inside, almost sick."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by PorkLordXS   What do ESTP's think of board games? Opinions on both strategy games like Risk and Dominion, and games like Cards Against Humanity.    I used to think they were fun, but generally I find them boring. I've played Risk a lot with my ENTJ brother. All the usuals that kids played in the 80s-90's growing up. One of my kids in the neighborhood had a gaming room and his mom used to invite everyone over for play dates, but I found those boring. "
ISFJ,"Thanks guys, these examples left pretty much no doubt that I am an ISFJ! "
ISFJ,"-You feel bad for days because you think you might have hurt someone's feelings unintentionally, and now you're formulating how you're going to fix it, your conscience is relentless!"
ISFJ,I know after work he doesn't like to bothered for an hour or so but I will definitely try that tomorrow. Thank you :3
INFP,"I seriously hate it when people think they can outsmart me or keep their motives secret from me just because I appear dramatic and oblivious. I can read your motives like a book and I even know if you're watching me. I know some who are very intelligent, but they can't make a fool out of me even with their subtle/silly moves."

INFJ,I think I might be intoxicated.  I think I don't care.    Shot 601 photos of the game tonight.  To the pub after the game... hanging with Zach & Dylan.  Good times.  Fun to hang with the youngsters sometimes.

You do want the best for her, but at what cost? Will she ever care for you as much as you care for her? To a normal reader it comes off that you have gotten the shorter end of the stick, but then again, that is based on what you have chosen to share. "
INFJ,"Ich bin ein kofferkuli!!!  (Not really.  I just love the word kofferkuli, lol)"
INFJ,"Therefore, I am eternal. Bow before me (all of us?), puny mortals!    hahah, i actually heard about that too. pretty awesome charmander btw B)"
INTJ,I appreciate the tolerance and insight everyone has shown me. It's really inspiring.
ISTJ,"I don't mind that one person described it as a ""troll getting out-troll'd"" at all. Yes, I could've been the mature one and backed off. But that would've ruined the fun. All I did was employ common sense to point out that maybe she wasn't handing out the best advice to OP and that her perception of the situation could be kind of clouded. I also pointed politely out that much of the fluff she was posting(her own personal life stories, experiences as a member of ""her generation"", etc) was with very few exceptions just irrelevant facts with little value to the OP.    I read that thread and chuckled mightily hard.  That is the certain non-INTJ/ISTJ member who followed me around for days through threads sniping at me and others.  You were let off the hook with the week ban with that one."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by SnowSun   Lol. I am thinking of Powerpuff girls:  sugar, spice and everything nice (plus Chemical X). Your formula makes Chemical X?    Nope, it makes babies, and unicorns and rainbows. hehehe"

INFJ,Belated Thanks!! I've worn one (not exactly the same) around my neck for like 5 years and was thinking about getting my avatar as a tattoo. I went to the tattoo shop and the dude said it was too intricate for a shoulder tattoo... which didn't really help my general level of indecision...
INFP,"I am completely in love with everyone here. I never knew there were other people who felt like me. Which is such an INFP thing to say, apparently. You know who I find frustrating? INFJs. Also, ISFPs. They take things way too seriously. I want to try and be happy. They seem to just want to wallow in misery. And I can't do anything to help them. "
INFP,"Jesus fuck.    Yeah, I got in trouble for responding to their posts with a picture of the album cover of Atom & His Package's Attention! Blah Blah Blah. I thought it was funny. I guess the mods did not agree. Oh well. It's their forum, they can do what they want with it. Lalala."

ENTP,"Originally Posted by gingertonic   This. ""American society"" is very, very different from an individual person.

Why can't they just be NT's and not give a shit who says what about whatever?"
INTJ,Quite a few INTJs well thought out hilarious replies with their tongue firmly in cheek.  Why do you think I come back here?
ISFJ,You want to do something nice for someone but worry you might do it wrong.
ENFJ,"You also remind me of some of the more type-ambiguous NFJs, like Nobleheart.  Have you ever considered ENFP?  (I know, I know, you and your Fi!  But it could be denial or projection  )"
ENTP,"Originally Posted by IDontThinkSo   too late, you lost all credibility     I never claimed to have any in the first place. I prefer outside-the-box solutions to mundane problems for my own personal interest, and am generally not concerned if others approve or not. Feel free to mark me down for zero and call it a day."
INFP,"What I really think of you? You are an annoying prick who thinks the world revolves around your country alone. You think you have high virtues, but I always sense that you are being fake. You want to live in a world of the most narrow minded generalizations and you often put feelings before facts without realizing it, it's okay to live there, just don't drag others into it and assume they're bad for not seeing things your way."
ESTP,You're not going to be able to finish this game cat.
ENTP,"they move faster - almost physically bounce around more. i move longer distances, directly    While generally it is true, some ENFPs are logical too. Things or people orientation depends too based on questions asked."

All NFP's and NTP's get auto free passes in my book."

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Tezkatlipoca   Ok, to me it seems ESFJ's tend to sort of idk, set high standards for themselves and other people then push them as far down the throat's of anyone who don't meet these standards.    I think ESTJs are more likely to do this than ESFJs.  It really depends on your moral upbringing, I think.  I think people from older generations are more likely to do this than younger ones, also."
ESTJ,Yes everyone BRAKES too XP But it is tiring and well even i need a break from it thats why we need periods to just let it out. These come in forms of stress relief activities and such. 
INTP,There is a necessary distance between the observer and the universe in order to understand it rather than to purely react to it.
INFJ,"Originally Posted by Coil   Tomorrow I'm gonna ask out the guy I've had a crush on for over a year. I'm writing it here so I don't back out. Can't understand why I'm so terrified, it's not like ""wanna see  a movie with me"" is such an extraordinary proposal.     Good luck!! :D"
ENFJ,"I'm so grateful to have my ENFP twin because I know someone truly understands what happens inside me when these things go bad. She knows what a horrible torture I go through. how I'm unable to defend myself against someone I trusted and let close to me, and how deeply I feel the inevitable loss and pain over what I know I must do. She knows I'm not being melodramatic and that's worth its weight in gold to me."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by stephiphi   You'll get through it. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, dear. :( *hugs*    thank you. Yeah, the letting go part really sucks. In my mind, I know it has to be done but it's just really painful."
ENTJ,"Am I just helpless or is this actually a Thing people (ENTJs?) do, and is there a method to making step by step details less stressful and frustrating?    Yes ma'am!"
ENTJ,Another thing is that we often have high expectations and romantic ideas about others - and often those are quite stereotypical. We might not focus on looks or things like that BUT many of us seems to think that somebody is gonna come and complete us. You don't think that expecting someone to balance you or make you feel better about yourself is stereotypical? How do you think that stereotypes take shapes? Why do you think that we have them? For NTs who rely on themselves and not others? I am not trying to be mean.    Yes! I loved you told me that! I mean its your understanding I am guessing correct? Can I not give my opinion? :( I mean I was just saying it has a chance to offend one of us. 
ISFJ,"My current stream.... Who the hell would attack the Boston Marathon?! That's gotta be a gathering of some of the most genuine people I can think of, all good people. People who like fitness, nutrition, the outdoors, who seem to be mostly feeler types, all things I can relate to.  Its f-ing sickening someone would attack this of all things. Something is up with all these other acts of violence lately though. It seems like people are lashing out specifically at society in general. American society/culture is pretty .....unforgiving(maybe not the most precise word) though on the other hand. Beyond the eventful good that people do possess when called upon and existing more in day to day treatment of one another, this culture can be, mean and cruel. Especially nowadays as well, it seems to be getting worse and worse. It ties into my general feeling that american culture is getting so unhealthy and people are more than ever, into their own ego building, are more competitive with others and less empathetic or willing to seek middle-sensible ground when it comes to viewpoints. All the people i work with are so hung up focusing on the shortcomings or negative things of others in order to look or feel better themselves. Its literally a sport for them.   There's no love at all for people who have a hard time fitting into the ideals that are rewarded in this culture.  Maybe this superficial, competitive, individualistic culture of today feeds these monsters who commit horrible acts of violence, like James Holmes shooting up that theater. But maybe the Boston incident was foreign terrorist related. Even so if its foreign terrorists then america is still being targeted and there must be some built up hatred with a reason. I mean when was the last time Canada was attacked by terrorists or by its own people? Man I feel like crap after thinking about all this negative stuff. I think I'll do my best to focus on the positives from the Boston bombing. There was so much selfless helping of the injured by people around. I'm glad instead of everyone running away a good amount went toward the chaos to help.  "
ISTJ,"So here's how it happened: My brother's best friend's sister (who was really awful to me at school- we are the same age) is transferring to a different college in CA. So her work wanted her to list a few people who could be her replacement... and for some reason, she asked me if I wanted to be on the list (pretty sure it was only me on that list). I know her parents pretty well for more than 5 years now, so I am thinking that maybe the mom suggested me as a possible candidate. "

I just don't think it's a good idea for something so personal, and so ephemeral, to dictate our very tangible, concrete, physical lives on a daily basis. Faith is probably a beautiful thing to experience, but it is not what should tell us what's right and wrong."
ISTP,"Haha it's not TOO weird. Just a little     Yeah, I mean I do get it. Being told I resemble Kristen Stewart isn't my favorite (I have a very generic white chick look I guess), or any other celeb. But it takes away the irritation when I realize people are just trying to be nice."

ISTJ,"That's my rant for today. You guys know how I roll. I've lived my life recognizing I'm not anything special. I don't tell people about the kind of economic and social bullshit I had deal with growing up. I don't wave around my past hardships as a flag for others to see.

INTP,"In my opinion, the rebuttal to that is:  to the degree people love what does not help others, is the degree of additional denial they add to their psyche.  Denial serves as a way to deal with lack of control and skill to reach the ideal, and allows us to still find things to be passionate about."

ISTP,"When I was in fifth grade I got tired of lying to my teacher about why I never did her homework and just told her I didn't feel like it. Naturally, she flipped out. I have no idea why, but I've been thinking about that all day. And considering how much I hated her, I have to wonder why I'm doing this to myself. Do you guys ever just get stuck on a bit of your past? Like your walking along, and then go 'why hello random memory. I do remember you rather well. Ok, I'm done reminiscing. You can go no.

I work with Doctors, Nurses, Dieticians, Psychologists, my BFF is a Criminal Defense Attorney, I have always dated doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc... so why am I so friggin scared to hell that I won't pass the stupid HIGH SCHOOL GED!

Sometimes on date nights or nights when  I'm hanging with my gf- if I'm not home she will call me or my husband or even my tenants nonstop , when I tell her I'm busy she  said she won't come , but she's always there, it stops me from going out or doing my own things and having family time  .How do I bring a polite end to this without offending her?

ISTJ,"Why are you friends with these people again?    Hehe, you know those NTs that I'm always complaining about? They're all gay. But I think it's more of an NT thing what they are doing. Well, obviously, since sexual orientation doesn't affect the way you act but your personality does to a point. You know how some NTs use their intelligence to make themselves look better than you? I think these guys have decided to use both their intelligence and their sexual orientation, perhaps even linking the two. But like what I say about those NTs, they can be really awesome at times but at other times they make you super pissed off. I'm not really sure if I've run into a middle ground, maybe when they're tired? I'm just totally speculating here. But yeah, that's my answer to why they're my friends, they can be super awesome sometimes. Plus, I live with one of the NTs, I need to get along with her. She already chased my other SJ housemate, she ain't doing that to me! I'm not letting myself get close enough to her to allow that to happen. "

I really don't feel well versed enough in MBTI and cognitive functions to say one way or the other, I am only now starting to discover things about myself that align so strongly with what I have read of INFJs. Of course we are a rare bunch, and I have read that it isn't easy to pin down a stereotype if you will of what INFJs are generally like. I dislike stereotypes, so I was hoping I wouldn't offend with my observation. You just seem to exude a different attitude than a lot of the INFJs I've been talking to."

ISFP,"The only person who can hurt me at my weak point is someone whose opinion I have come to value--close workmate or my spouse, or a close friend--belittling something I did, or belittling the heart behind the work. It's hard for me to put into words, and since it never/seldom happens, I can't think of any examples to help me. But here's the thing. I solicit their opinions and criticisms. They may hurt emotionally, but I _always_ but _always_ take what they say seriously, and typically, even if I argue at first, will apply their advice to my work. But here again, I have made myself vulnerable to them first. Other people, it's more like ""who do you think you are?""    I would not consider authenticity in terms of integrity, since integrity does not depend on the persons personal created view, yet it may seem so, but underneath it can easily reveal itself as a copy of someone else's belief without understanding why you have decided to believe something and make it part of yourself."
INFP,"So why the %$#^ do I let myself be taken over by my friends' stupid decisions? Just because they are mislead doesn't mean I have to sit there and mope with them.

That doesn't mean she can just dump you when things get tough.  She should be there for you, especially when you're emotional and need her support.  People are so complicated.

The only thing standing in the way really is a new fuel... which we have to work on for our ground vehicles anyway. That all being said, someone needs to slap the presidency and get NASA some more funds... might take a few years.

When i first met him I never even knew his name (was at a party) and we danced together in the street to imaginary music, I didn't see him again for 6 months in which time I had made him into an inspirational character in a book i was writing. then finally found out who he was through a friend through a weird stroke of luck and we met up again. It was all a bit weird. When you've attached a real person to a character it's going to be hard living up to that i suppose. Not sure why I was thinking about all this but I was!"

I do spend the majority of most typical days engrossed in the internet, which wouldn't be a problem so much if I had my priorities straight, but I find it impossible because of my lack of discipline to accomplish the little in this world I do have to accomplish. I know I use the internet for escapism, productive as it can be. I fail to do even the simplest tasks because ""I'm in the middle of something"" or ironic moments like ""I had to follow a train of thought before I forgot; that's why I forgot to do such and such task"". I snap at people for interrupting me, and ignore and miss out on a lot of the wonderful things going on around me. I can hardly have a conversation without bringing up something I read or found or like about the internet, or just being totally distractible from all responsibilities and obligations by every whim and notification. I am currently involved in no activities, programs or studies, not even hobbies, or even honing favorite skills, of any kind and that's just lame. There are also certain influences on the internet that just overwhelm me and cause me to dump my values. I feel a lack of control on internet because it is so infinite... All unlike the time in a day I have to accomplish my chores and treat people with respect. I want to limit not my internet time so much as the boundaries of my mind, and to broaden the limit I currently put on my life by allowing my mind to wander in infinity, where my body and soul and willpower can't follow.

ISFP,"Another question for my fellow ISFPs out there: can you guys give me any advice on how I might be more effectively... effective at life? Like... keep organized about the stuff that you really have to be organized about like finances? Its not even that I get overwhelmed and procrastinate... it's just that I cannot, for the life of me, remember to do those things on time or in any sort of organized way... I'll think, ""Oh, I need to do this, I better make that call today, but I'll grab my coffee first."" And then two weeks later be like, ""Oops... damn... got distracted with other things and forgot."" I've made spreadsheets to help me remember (very pretty and well organized spreadsheets) but that lasted all of one month before I started getting distracted with other things and forgetting to keep up with on a day to day basis... anyone have any advice?

I know I am way behind in answering this, but I have been doing an informal poll of all of my closest friends, and the vast majority are xNFJ, with a few ESFx in the mix.  I know of one (just one!) ISTJ, and one is ENFP.  The most interesting thing to me is that the ""S""s are all people with whom I felt like I had to work a little harder for the friendship - they weren't just these instantaneous BFFs like most of the NFs.  There's some drama here and there with all of my friends, but it's usually not directed at me, so I let them stay, ha.  "

And it is torturing me. "

ENTJ,"On a superficial level, I hate being asked how my day is. It's the most generic throwaway question in existence and it's small talk which is a waste of time. Slightly off-topic but, in general, I don't like talking about emotions and feelings. For example. if it's someone who's suffering through a break-up I'd rather discuss the reasons behind it and the next steps to address it rather than being asked to console that person."

I completely agree, so don't worry that you're overthinking anything. Unfortunately, the passive-aggression can be a product of keeping too much information to ourselves, and his reaction seems like a cathartic response to having kept what he noticed to himself for so long. If this happens a lot, he may be somewhat unhealthy and hasn't learned to gradually release his concerns. Has he mentioned and pinpointed exactly why the filter bothers him? If that can be determined, it might help to have a candid conversation and see if you can work something out. Just as you said, communication is paramount."
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Alette   How can you tell the difference between ESTJs and ISTJs?    ESTJs project energy when they speak. ITSJs seem to maintain energy when they speak (unless they're with really good friends, at which point it can be difficult to tell them apart)."

ISTJ,"Nope, I'm actually a FULL 100% T who is overcompensating.  Additionally, I actually took the cognitive functions test, and out of all the INTJs that took it, only one had less Fe than me and only four had less Fi than me.  For some reason though, the faces REALLY do amuse me.  If you look at the Oldham's Personality Style Test (which I posted on the ISFJ Forum), which in my opinion is MUCH better than MBTI, I score highest as Self Confident type and Vigilant type, but I also score high in Aggressive Type and Dramatic type (which means that unlike most INTJs, I can be fun! ).    If you're an INTJ, you're using Fi only, no Fe, regardless of what a cognitive function test says. Also, you aren't a 100% T, that's not what those test results mean. You're either T or you're not, there aren't amounts involved. The percentage is how confident you can feel, based on your understanding of yourself, the questions, and your answers and the bias of the designer of the test, that you are a T. Have you read the intj descriptions in depth?"

INTJ,"Originally Posted by dalsgaard   I'll try to describe it, but it's rather hard to quantify. The experience I had with these streams of associations were very sporadic and too fast to ever commit to paper. All I have left is a few nonsensical notes on straps of paper, saying things like ""'I don't know' negates dualism"" and ""The eye cannot see itself"". I was trying to find out how my mind worked.    Yeah, I have that as well, where I have things in a notebook with pretty much exactly what you have described, little phrases here and there, symbolic musings and so forth. It's funny that you mention dualism though, that's part of my theory. Your experience(s) kind of reminds me of my earlier stages, when I was trying to figure out what was going on, however I would take it a step further and find more meaning within one phrase. My Ni would see multiple, yet subtle possibilities, that the ""normal"" eye would not necessarily see. Those possibilities were subliminal messages giving new ways of looking at things from multiple perspectives and my mind just loved playing with those possibilities.      Originally Posted by dalsgaard   What I realized was that my subconscious would come up with constant strings of seemingly random pieces of information, and I had a mediator that would put these pieces together on a higher level of consciousness. On top of that, I would have 'me' who reacted to these pieces of information, but often my own reaction would give rise to its own reaction. I noticed a tendency of the mind to make constant connotations on any given subject, but if I were to focus my mind on itself, then the connotations were always the same yet I wouldn't seem to realize it. I would reach a certain conclusion and revel in how it explained everything, but that same conclusion would soon be subject to the same scrutiny that had caused it. I realized how desire lead to certain forms of destructive behavior for instance, but no sooner had I realized that, before I realized that my own desire to figure that out must therefore also be destructive. And the more I attempted to delve into my own mind, the more I ran into this sort of recursive logic. The mere fact of observing what was going on seemed an impossibility for a variety of reasons. I tried to tell myself by words like ""The eye cannot see itself"", but it didn't matter particularly, because I was not in control of it anymore. It was like domino bricks falling, they were beyond my control."

In six months I will have a bachelors and be making more money than that man ever will, at twenty I joined the freaking military, I may keep my thoughts to myself but if that man ever said I had no value based solely on the fact that I have no job to my face, it would be war!

I'm not under the impression that an ENTJ would completely abandon their objectivity no matter how right they think they are or how bad of a day they're having.    Ne can be very frustrating for me.

ESTJ,"It sounds like you want to live as an adult and make your own lifestyle decisions. That's all fine and good, but it means you also need to take up the living/financial mantle of adulthood.

Any ideas how to show a young ENFP they are being manipulative?    INITIAL WARNING:  He might never like you.  There are some people who I just hated right when I met them, and I never had a real reason for it.  I found a lot of good ones, but none of them were the real cause.  It took herculean effort from one of them to go from loathsome to barely tolerable in my mind.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by mangodelic psycho   This is a different kind of asshole than what furry is describing bellow; I wouldn't even consider telling someone that their idea sucks or that it needs reformatting, being an asshole. But TJs have to make it perfect, and the only person who can do this is themselves, so they're being assholes, indermining and treating others as incompetent, because it's a control thing? Not sure. As soon as the task is over, they go back to their usual, jovial self, until the next ""challenge"". Thoughts?    *sigh* How you say something is to some, as important or more important than what you're actually saying. Telling someone, ""Your idea sucks!"" is both an asshole thing to say and it's completely non-constructive feedback and is pointless to say to someone. If you approached the same person and said, ""Well, your idea will have some difficult problems here and we don't have the resources for that so we can't follow up on this idea. We have this idea which will be less problematic, we have the resources and will go on to meet our stated goals more closely. Because of that, we're with *person*''s idea instead."" that is way more constructive and less assholish than saying someone's idea sucks without explaining why. Oh and the TJ stereotyping you're doing sounds nothing like me and is definitely not typical ENTJ behavior. Such a place sounds dysfunctional once clear roles were established and it sounds to me that people need to be reshuffled around."

ENTJ,"My close friends find this all hilarious because they tell me I flirt constantly. I do it like breathing and don't give it much thought. When I am flirting, I will sometimes touch people - pat on the back, light touch on the arm, etc. That doesn't bother me at all, but generally if I am flirting with you, I don't care about you - at least not romantically. I read a quote that sums it up, ""Flirting is the art of avoiding intimacy."" If I really like you I generally won't flirt with you or it is very subdued. I will treat you different than everyone else. Many MB types will pick up on it, but other ENTJs and INTJs generally don't pick up on the differences in my behavior.    I'm exactly the same. Happy to touch a bicep every now and again when I'm flirting, but if I'm seriously considering someone as relationship material I'm probably going to be more stand-offish. I remember walking arm-in-arm with a guy I'd been seeing on-off for a few years and he tried to hold my hand and I recoiled in horror. I pretty much told him on the spot that I don't do PDAs (not necessarily true, but it just felt so wrong with him). Even thinking about it makes me feel a little ill."

INTJ,"Originally Posted by Adesi   I'm now beginning to think that while my friend may be a TJ, he simply has a better developed F than me, and that perhaps when compared to myself, he seemed like an F. He is more concerned with group dynamics and how decisions affect individuals than I am it seems. Now I'm thinking that perhaps he is a possibly an INTJ with either an 8 or a 9 as an enneagram (which is not uncommon for an INTJ I don't think?), which made him seem different from what I've come to expect from INTJs.    While beth will be able to give you a more comprehensive answer, I'd just say that I come across a lot more sensitive in comparison to my other thinker friends (a few ISTJs and one INTP). Also, I've found (albeit from limited personal experience) that INTJs seem to be able to blend in well when they want to - more so than ISTJs. Finally, although I don't know a lot about enneagram, most indications point towards me being 5w6, so he doesn't necessarily have to be an 8 or 9. "
INFP,People make me nervous. I am very selfconsious. I worry about what others think of me. But I get tired of not meeting people too.

INFP,"But, I do believe that this is a world where for as low as you can go, that is also as high as you can go. If you are able to find some way to continue to keep that seed of hope that is inside you alive, it will blossom and that will help to turn your life back around. I'm very much so of the opinion that heaven and hell are not some place we go after we die, but where we are in our lives while we're alive. It is possible to pull yourself back from hell, to pull yourself back up. It's easier with a bit of help, but I will never say that it is an easy thing. It takes work and effort and a willingness to take leaps of faith that somehow, someway, /something/ will work in your favor. That something could be big or small, but each something is a bit of water and soil for that seed of hope. It will never erase the past, but it may make the present something better than what it was."

ESTJ,"Originally Posted by thewindlistens   Do the words 'anger' and 'abusive' somehow come close to the definition of the ESTJ type for you (or even the stereotype)? If they do, they shouldn't. Those are words describing a mentally unhealthy individual, not the good portion of everyday humanity that ESTJ and similar types represent. Any individual with problems can be agressive, passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful, from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between. An ESTJ who accepts himself and learns to live with his own weaknesses will never be abusive or angry by simple definition, no more than an INFP or any other introverted feeler."
ISFP,"Now as to a more ISFP perspective. I suspect you are asking for something that ISFPs really are not able to give--effusive speech on topics very near and dear to them. It just ain't gonna happen--and certainly not over long distance. We need a face, and we need to know that it is ok to say what we are going to say... And even then, a paucity of words is more likely (or at least of any ""meaningful"" words). To put it simply, Fi just isn't a verbal function. It isn't expressive, and doesn't show itself directly, but rather indirectly, but good luck figuring it out. ;-) But this letter sounds fine--from one friend to another. I don't know if you were looking for more or not... "
ISFJ,"I mostly have good interactions with ENTP and adore their playfulness and ability to let things go but definitely in the past I've had issues with ENTPs not understanding ""premises"" and pushing me off as being over-emotional in my reasoning.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Whatexists   I generally agree about this. Major exception being that I enjoy talking about feelings and emotions in an abstract sense, which is to say that I love psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc. I spend a lot of time dealing with them and thinking about them (mine in particular) so it's something I think a lot about and therefore have thoughts about I like to talk about. I also am pretty good at imagining myself in others shows and am very sympathetic to other peoples feelings and am happy to listen. BUT I do keep my own feelings to myself and don't want other people to try to deal with them. I want them to just give me the facts and let me deal with it. ENTJ, ESTJ... those personality types are probably very well suited to this.    Actually, I would agree with this.... in an abstract sense. In fact, I am capable, of some things and some times, of talking about my feelings--or rather, analyzing my feelings--dissecting them, etc. And in those cases, input is something I want. Also, I am prone to analyze others' feelings in the same way--dissect, etc. trying to get to the ""why"" of it--but that seems to really get under the skin of some people (who I suspect are Fe types), and they don't like it. Also, warning--doing so can lead to pushing an unexpected button... "

ISFP,"These are great questions. If I am overspending, I see it in the ledger and have to change my habits.   In relationships I can be very flexible and accommodating to another. This quality of swaying to flex to another persons demands is what perpetuates demise in overtly unbalanced relationship. (So you probably say, why do this then?   Innate wiring?  IDK.).  In this case things have to get ""very bad"" before I do anything about it. I am a thin person, and I left a position only after I lost 15 pounds becoming dangerously very thin and having problems sleeping from the stress as well as problems getting up from the lack of sleep.  I felt committed to my job. So in this case my health had to take a substantial decline before I intervened.  The biggest reasons for delay in action are twofold.  First, when I am posed with a huge decision such as a position change/ big confrontation my mind becomes bogged, almost paralyzed for action.  Second, when my mind is struggling with a morally charged issue such as a commitment, my ""feeling"" is so strong my action to confront/act/change also becomes paralyzed, because I am using so much energy just dealing with the emotions involved.  Oh how I envy those that function by logic and facts!! It seems so much easier...so much clearer.   This is where my logical friends' support is gold.  These insights have all been pointed out by others in my life helping me to see what I couldn't see. Thank God we are all different and that we have caring supportive peeps to help us out.  Life can be hard stuck in our own minds sometimes:)."
ENTP,"But if the answer is just a straight ""No"" then I'll just stop and walk away while making some side-remark about their intelligence to goad them into giving chase.

I was a lot like you in my younger years [between 22-28] before it all crashed and burned around me and I realized now that it was ultimately my ENTP-ish nature of not being judgemental, of being open-minded in my world-views mixed in with the show-off nature of the type 3 Enneagram that had won me a lot more enemies secretly than friends.

I wish they would be more self sacraficing to the people who need them most in their lives. Sometimes I think life would be so much easier if I just didn't care, but the emotions never go away they are always there and I can't change the deep concern I feel for others sometimes."

This homework was graded on completion, so there should have been no issue with them consulting the solution manual as long as they were not copy-pasting and didn't understand what they were turning in.  Anyhow, these people will have a trial with my university's honor council.  But since my professor did not know whether others were cheating, she and the dean of the business school decided that our homework grades were no longer going to be used in computing our grade.  I'm kind of mad because I spent hours on doing those homework assignments to not have them be included as part of our grade, even if the homework assignments were purely busy work and should never have been assigned in the first place.

ISFJ,"By the way, I love your display picture! :D    Wow, that's really good. I've known my INTP sister for 18 years and she's still a mystery lol. I know her well enough to know when something is bothering her but it's hard for her to come out and say it and it's hard for me to come to her and acknowledge the fact that something is bothering her. Oh and thanks so much! I just love Spongebob."

ENTJ,"Well I was curious cuz female ENFPs act slightly differently than male ENFPs. Like Ariel and Aladdin kind of thing. Both are ENFPs, but you can tell they act differently in their own way but are of the same type. Its like a subtle distinction in how they talk, speak, listen and of course act. It made me curious if other than NFs or Feelers, NTs function differently."

For example, I'll ask ""Do you like X"" and the will go ""Yeap :D"", and since they didn't say why, I'll ask ""Ooh why?"" and they will say ""Oh because blahblahblah"". And then I'll go ""Oh cool! :D Do you like Y?"" and they will go ""YESSS!"". So sometimes it feels like they aren't really into our conversation, and that's boring for me :P But other than that, INFJs are sweethearts<3"

ISFJ,"So, it's all a bit frustrating, and I'm expending a lot of energy trying to suppress this frustration because he's my dad and I shouldn't have to be angry about him not being a big adult. The stress of it has been wearing on me, and that along with the stress of a new, more demanding semester of classes, plus the social isolation I've felt being without a phone (even telling people to just facebook me instead has led some of them to just say ""text me when your phone comes back on"" instead of accommodating for my circumstances... as if they're not on facebook anyway) and the bitter cold have been killing me. I'm stressing about all sorts of things, and while I'm handling it mostly well by keepin' on as usual, I'm spending more of my alone time (which I've had abundance of) thinking about how I gained weight over break and I haven't been getting to the gym enough since I'm back, how I start field experience soon and don't know if I'll be accommodated fully, how my skin is oily and breaking out (which leads to my bangs getting greasier along with my forehead, leading to me having to shower more than usual, which takes up time), and how I was at the top of my game before break and now everything is suddenly working against me and life is throwing more challenges at me than I thought I'd have to deal with."

ENTP,"Perhaps the definitive research on the subject was conducted by a consortium based at San Juan University by a team jointly led by Dr. Hiram Walker and Dr. Ron Bacardi.  Though their research was inconclusive as to the exact cause and makeup of the phenomenon known as love, the doctors were able to conclude that the desirability of lab animals increased in direct proportion to the quantity of light and/or dark rum administered.  In fact, noted Walker, the effect was not limited solely to the test subjects.  ""After watching a thousand monkeys going at it for eighteen hours a day,"" he wrote, ""my naughty bits got to atingling!  Even ol' Doc Bacardi was starting to look pretty good  in that smooth, soft, virgin-white lab coat with the slit up the leg."" "
INFP,Comparative to most of this forum I feel like the black sheep.

I know people who can't even afford lunch and are struggling to meet ends meet yet some ministers can have the cheek to be disgruntled about the pay cut! Grrrr."
ENTJ,Sympathy for me is more of a sliding scale based on a rational thought process:

I'm pretty sure I sound like Barry White when I talk cause that's what most posts sound like. "
ESTJ,^^ That is a pretty stereo-typical ESTJ as well .. and a positive one.
ISTJ,"Also, after I posted that, I belatedly realized another reason may be because there are a lot of female ENFP's, and a lot of male ISTJ's, but not so much in the reverse.

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Signseeker   So, I have an ISFJ friend who is constantly upset by the delusion that people in her life are mad at her or hate her.

So... what's a good way to put this... Is paranoia common in ISFJ's? I would say that I feel some paranoia myself but my Ni and Ti come to my rescue and say, ""Big picture, people don't break off friendships for this kind of stuff.""    Yeah.. I can get like that fairly often. And I can't really get over it until I feel better, and while convincing myself logically can help a bit, it won't fully go away.

INFJ,"Sorry I made you lose.     LOL, that's alright. I was merely an intermediary in the long-forgotten process of making several friends rage for a moment, which was fun . I hate it too, haha."
ESTJ,"What do you consider a great act of kindness?    I believe that everyone has the same worth, but again I'm a subjective human being, and therefore value people different. So rather than saying that I judge the worth of people, I'd say I judge their worth to me, and what they can contribute with to me and to the society. If they don't do what they're assigned on time, that would decrease this. If they hinder the progression of things by being plain stupid, things like that. But still, it doesn't decrease their actual worth or value, just how I view them. "

It all depends on the job--and seniority. :-)"
INTP,Just kidding. Saying that it doesn't make a sounds implies that humans are so transcendent that sound can't occur without anyone present to observe it.
ENTJ,"I do think a lot of this is because of where I live.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by FlightsOfFancy   Do you find that your less likely to feel depressed because you are 'in the moment'?    Most definitely. I think a lot of unwanted, negative emotions stem from over thinking and as a ""here and now"" person, I don't indulge in such activity.   "
ISTP,"Logically, letting them fall off for the growth of humanity is more than reasonable. Morally, we should help them stand since that is what makes humans ""better"" then animals. But why?

It surprised me so much that she would be like this. It's not like I pushed the book on her or anything, she just seems to HATE things that people recommend to her straight away. It's really frustrating when you're excited about something! Everyone I know who has read the book on my recommendation loved it, but she just won't budge. It's annoying because I know she would have some really good ideas about it! *sigh* please help!    I end up hating things that most people recommend for me. I feel like I almost have a sixth sense for knowing what I'll like and what I won't. As sherkanner said above, we tend to only do things if we can fully see that it will be useful or beneficial to us by our own reasoning.

INFJ,"On a related note, that's one of the same tests they use to detect autism/Asperger's, which include social deficiency (language?) problems. And at least in the case of Asperger's, intelligence plays no role in the deficiency.  There's a big animal behavior researcher at my college who is autistic and says she got involved in her field because animal behavior is like autism...I don't quite agree with her, there, but I do wonder...animals don't speak our language, even our body language, very easily, unlike our own species. Autistics have trouble with language and communicating, not intelligence (or not always--depends where they are on the spectrum). So, I do think the phenomenon he's touching on here is more to do with communication than to do with intelligence."

ISFP,"((I am close to both a ISFP and an ISTP and I can easily see the Se in the ISTP, but it's harder for me to see in the ISFP - I mostly see it in appreciation of arts for the latter. The ISTP is more analytic and surveying the surroundings and ""maps out"" the area.))    For me particularly? I can explain how Se manifests for me far easier than how Fi manifests. So I'll start there. Appreciation of the arts is a good place to kick off from. Arts are visually pleasing. Extend that to other senses: soft clothing and sheets, hot showers, hot tubs, cool rain, swimming in cool lakes, the way your skin seems to stretch when it's getting dried from sitting too close to a fire. I love feeling things textures, whether they're hard, sharp, smooth, cold, abrasive, etc... I'll run my fingers along walls as I walk simply to experience the texture under my finger tips (or along hand rails. I love the different feelings of wood hand rails, chrome ones, painted metal where the paint is chipping...), or when I'm king in nature sometimes I stop just so that I can run my hand over the bark of a tree and feel the peeled parts and the healthy parts that are strong and wholesome. Skin is among the most wonderful things to be able to touch, especially soft skin. There is something deeply connective about touch, about really feeling. You can feel somethings lifeforce, it's strength, it's weakness, it's injuries and trials in it's skin. I love scars. That touch feel of smooth skin turning momentarily tender and dimpled from a long past hurt. Extend this sort of constant attention and appreciation of sensory information to other sense. Even as I'm talking about this I'm noting the soft pattering of the keys (not like rain, but there is something relaxingly similar about that), the dryness in my mouth because I haven't drunken anything, the warmth of my laptop increasing in my lap as it's starting to heat up from lack of proper ventilation. I'm constantly aware of my environment. There is a small tightness/burning in my stomach/chest/solar plexus region and my right knee is tense because the position I'm sitting in is applying pressure to it in an uncomfortable way. Both sensations are tiny, but they're present. Small enough that I know they aren't actually indicators of anything to worry about, like the aching in my right index knuckle from cracking it a little while ago. I'm constantly noticing sensory information of all kinds all around me even when I'm trying to focus on other things. "

ESTP,"Originally Posted by Born12   Hey ESTPs! I am having trouble typing my friend, sort of. When he took the test online he got ESTP but I am slightly skeptical yet not skeptical. He does display a lot of the OUTSIDE stereotypical concepts of an ESTP. He can sometimes say things that are pretty blunt and obvious but really this is just a question if he is feeling or thinking. He sometimes appears really upset when he loses something, I could just be looking too deep (that's why I came to question the ultimate realists). He is very adventurous and definitely has that entrepreneur mentality but I sometimes wonder if that is just a face he puts on. His Dad is definitely xSTP so I wonder sometimes if it's just he feels like he has to be like his Dad or just got that influence somehow.  So my real question is, what do a lot of you do when you happen to get upset about something? Do you sulk or anything like that? I know not every ESTP is the same but I am trying to see if there are any trends here. Sorry I didn't give much info, just trying to get some thoughts on how to determine for sure he is an ESTP. Because he acts it but I feel like he isn't, it could just me being Fi biased.    An ESTP wouldnt sulk unless it was EXTREMELY important and/or could leave him vulnerable. However T or F in my experience isn't how emotional someone is, rather than how they deal with their emotions. So thereby, sulking, it tends to be more Feeling. If he is more rational and have the mentality of ""no time for feelings, waste of time"" hes probably ESTP. "

ISTJ,"Ok, so a couple of my friends had a huge problem with this thing on facebook where people from our school poke basketball players from our rival school. My school is a huge basketball school, our men made it to the second round of the tournament and our women lost in the elite eight. When you add this to the fact that we don't have a football team, you can picture that we get crazy during basketball season. From where I stand, there is nothing ""offensive"" about poking rival basketball players on facebook. I hardly doubt their feelings were hurt. And yet my friends chastised these people on facebook, started a debate, and even told them that they wondered how they were smart enough to be at the university when they were clearly stupid. Ugh. Anyway, that's not really what I'm ranting about. What I'm ranting about is if these people are soo much more mature than the rest of us college students who like our rivalries, than why in the world would they get a kick our of drinking Four Loko and other hard alcohol? If you ask me, that's a lot more immature than poking your rival basketball players on facebook. And they didn't act like it was a personal thing that they wanted to do, one of them was practically treating the other one as childish for not wanting to do it! "

For sure she's just a friend, but he's really invested in helping her to improve. Investing in the lives of other people to that extent is a foreign concept to me. Live and let live is my motto. Yes, I will offer advice when asked, but I definitely wouldn't have the patience to invest time and effort over time. In any case, very annoying to be the girlfriend in that situation."

I'm always surprised when I visit the local Guitar Center and see parents buying their kids expensive instruments...when they have no musical experience! Start with something reasonably priced and you can always move up if they stick with it. At the end of the school year I see lots of parents trying to sell back that instrument because their child lost interest (which happens frequently once they find out how much work and dedication it takes) Then the parents are shocked at how low the buy-back is "

INTJ,"Originally Posted by Abraxas   There's this general stereotype of INTJs being really obsessed with efficiency, having an urge to devote themselves to their intellectualism with a kind of rigor that other types lack, which stems from their 'J-ness'. They hate incompleteness or 'dabbling' in things, and like ENTJs, value mastery of their interests - although, unlike ENTJs, they're not so concerned with the approval of their peers as much as meeting their own high-standards. I'm just wondering if that really applies, or if it's just made up based on various personal interpretations of the cognitive functions. I.E. I'm looking for some evidence from the 'horse's mouth' to validate some of what I've been reading lately around the web, since so much of it sounds like speculation based on what the writer has read in a book.    I'm quite laid-back (read: lazy), so I'll commonly seek the most efficient way of doing something purely because I don't want to waste too much effort doing it."

ENFJ,"I'm sorry if I've offended all my fellow ExFJ... that's just been brewing for a little while.    I don't mean to intrude with any advice because after all you're just venting. But I have a feeling that she's developed a very tough external shell in order to protect a fragile inner core - which may be because she may be hurting inside and not even recognizing it. Dis-satisfaction with living conditions, seemingly insurmountable expectations leads to internal worry that makes an ENFJ want to be cared for and shown kindness, but also set up another barrier in the guise of ""not being asked the right way"". I've done this in the past as well where I made myself unappealing to a certain group of friends because I felt like I didn't really belong, and I wanted someone to step up and make me feel belonged.

It's like people don't realize that it's genetics.. and they're basically insulting something I have no control over.    True.

ISFP,"Generally, I hate being felt sorry for by others. However, when I feel hurt by other people, who  start criticizing my personal character flaws or bad habits, I can be emotionally manipulative and make people feel sorry for me by offering  personally self-critical remarks, and self-denigrating comments as explanations as to why my personality is flawed the way the way that others point out. It's such a natural emotional self-defense mechanism for me to personal criticism that I sometimes don't even realize that I'm being emotionally manipulative right away to try and get others to feel bad for doing so to me."

INTJ,"Frankly, though, I wouldn't call someone ""cold"" just because they tried to appear calm/strong/unruffled. For whatever reason, she probably doesn't have that negative judgement attached to trying to be 'strong' in that way. Accepting her when she is weak (ie feeling like a victim to emotions) and not trying to undermine her when she is trying to be otherwise would be the best bet, I suspect. This is a guess. And maybe you consider it stronger to show her emotions, but she is neither an F, an extravert, or someone with Fe, so even if she were healthy, it is unlikely that she would consider unadulterated emotional expression right for her. There would likely be some kind of reserve that is natural. You don't of course have to agree with how she sees emotion - but if it is harming her to be like this, I would suggest reacting to the harm rather than steering her to what you consider healthy, since it may well be different for you than her and INTJs rarely react well to the latter. But if she opens up to you, and that's already more than with most people, well...you're doing ok, just continue to be accepting and nonjudgemental."

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Ikusagami   The fact she regarded some of the most arbitrary things as close-guarded secrets that could ""destroy"" her if they got out to her friends was utterly nonsensical to me.    That reminds me of a conversation I had with an INTJ friend. I abruptly confessed, 'I don't understand the notion of privacy'. He was incredulous. I explained that in things that are deemed 'private' there can either be secrets (such as the likes you wouldn't want the police knowing) or your own stupidity. Why you would want to hide your secrets is sensible, but why people feel the need to hide details about their sex life, or other 'arbitrary' stuff which every normal human being engages in, is just beyond me. I can only conclude that the phrase 'it's private' only means: you need to spend more time with me, or I'm fucking stupid. Privacy, then, is subterfuge. Notice that wherever you use the phrase 'it's private', you can also simply lie without repercussions. Of course it does not entail that I should be willing to give people my address or other detail which they can use to 'materially' exploit me. But I want to limit it to the language-games involving privacy. It's nonsense. There's nothing that is 'private' which can also be put into words. And whatever can be put into words, is not private."

ESFP,"ESTP and ESFP social dynamics differ as well as a result of their judging differences. ESTPs tend to charge through social situations, bringing people with them and causing collateral damage, often unbeknownst to them. Their personal relationships can be very messy. That's true of ESFPs too, but ESTPs can be so clueless about the art of getting close to people that they may feel totally unlovable deep down, or disregard vulnerability entirely due to having the shittiest Fi possible. If ESFPs are gonna fuck up their relationships, we tend to get vulnerable with people and bond deeply, then get pissed by something they do and blow them off in a dramatic rage (which we can sometimes forget a week later, depending on the severity of the ""betrayal"", lol). ESFPs are considerably more inconsistent than ESTPs. ""Tempestuous emotions"" are sort of a trademark (I'm fairly certain I've read that on a Socionics page too). ESTPs get very pissed too, but it takes them longer, and it's usually for a good reason if they do. I think we tend to be ""moodier"". We're more likely to sit and wallow in our sadness/anger/what have you and do something irrational out of the blue.

So, he comes across as being arrogant and rude.  I do not have this problem with him because I understand his thought process.  I never have to tell him to do anything twice.  "

I say that to set you up for the next. Later, Calvin returns to the duplicator and adds in an ethicator feature that only duplicates the good side of Calvin. That person would be the ISFJ side of Calvin. I guess, that, in such a scenario, the iSFP is the other side of Calvin. ;-)"
ENTJ,"ISFPs are upside down ENTJs. They often try to do the same things ENTJs are attracted to naturally (working high in organisation ladder) but have all the impatience and bad organisation skills of ESFPs just worse. So, in my experience, I clash in every possible way with all ISFPs I've ever met. I'm too cold for them, too workaholic, too pressuring, too unexciting, too single-minded, too direct, too goal oriented etc. Reverse them and you get my opinion of the ISFPs I know."

ENFJ,I think I'm ready to accept surface connections into my life again. I'm getting too much wrapped up in people.

He said he felt being in a family 'tied him down', not that he doesn't love us; but he would of liked to live his life just doing adventurous things, doing what he wants and not, feeling 'tied down'. Also, he seems to never admit he forgot to do something, just domestic things like, not putting the butter back in the fridge, leaving things out etc. He's done it heaps of times, but then when he gets angry and goes on about tidying up etc, oh apparently he's NEVER done it, he ALWAYS, puts things away, apparently we do it ALL the time, its never him. If you TRY to say something, he'll just start talking over the top of you going, ""No, no you guys do it all the time, I always put things away"", just keeps justifying things when yoy oppose him. It gets really fucking annoying, so most of the time our family just agrees to disagree just to keep him happy. I hate doing it, my interactions with him a lot of the time feels so superficial because I'm just trying to not make him angry. I feel sad about it because he's my dad and I want a more deeper relationship with him, but I just feel distant to him sometimes, (all of my family actually)."

If it's annoying but there's a point to it with measurable results-- it's manageable. There's also the issue of picking your battles wisely because if everything is nitpicked and dissected people tend to get fatigue from you. It results in resentment, avoidance, or both.

The not opening up or sharing things seems to be a popular thing amongst most introverts however.     I agree with you, although the thing with INTP's is that we need to be able to trust someone before we tell them anything and everything. I have an ENFJ friend that I tell everything, and another INTP whom I tell everything. I, personally, open up A LOT when I trust someone, because I find they won't judge me for not knowing anything about how to express emotion. XD"

To not get bogged down in the present.  To look beyond it, figure out why it was important and what I truly valued.

Those people who scream at you for leasing instead of just buying new would probably shut up if I were to walk up to them and tell them if they were so concerned with saving money, they would instead always buy used and service their own vehicles, including oil changes and transmission fluid flushes. This route is arguably the most frugal route to go, but for the rest of us average joes and janes, there's the question of convenience and time. Not all of us have the expertise to do all the major and minor servicing and repairs. "

I'd figure you made a boneheaded decision, as we all do from time to time in this life. This time it didn't have harsh or fatal consequences, so you dodged a bullet. The questions are, what are you going to learn from this experience, and what steps do you take now so it doesn't happen again? If I were in a relationship with you, I'd want you to take a serious look at how much alcohol affects you and whether it's at the point where it's controlling you, instead of the other way around. If you're still in control, never mix drinking and driving again. If it's controlling you, you need to seek out treatment for your addiction. Whatever happens don't be in denial about what's really going on. If your date cares about you, she will appreciate that honesty. I can't speak for her or any other ISFJ's, but if my date blew off the seriousness of the situation that would be a red flag that this person will be more trouble than they're worth down the road, and that it's time to leave."

ISFP,"Originally Posted by lunaticrabbits   Hmm. Sometimes deep discussions are nice, but I feel like there's only a limited amount of those deep/abstract topics I can talk about. Also when talking, I mostly think about what I can surely know is true, so theorizing might be a little difficult. I would be fine talking about my own moral views, but the subject of morality itself... I don't know, it sounds far fetched but it could be possible, even if only a little. "

ISFP,"Yet she still hasn't broken up with me. We've slept together, and I was her first. I've had quite a few sexual partners, but all this roller coaster of drama has made our bedroom moments absolutely phenomenal. For perhaps two months after we did the deed, she was really close with me, and we shared a level of emotional vulnerability and intimacy that I didn't even know existed - and in bed is the only time she's treated me as an equal. Now we've stopped having sex, and she's constantly pushing me to leave. It's like she hates me because she got so close to me. "
ENTJ,"I can be very empathetic though. I respond to raw emotion, especially grief, and I get quite upset if someone I love starts crying. I will hold them until they stop, then get them a hot face cloth, rinse and repeat until they feel better.    "

When I realized that I couldn't save it, my arms went up and in, and I went down on my left knee ... and then slid across the floor for about ten feet. It knocked the wind out of me, but I was otherwise fine.  The duct tape on my left skate took a beating and there are three giant marks on my knee pad now.  Anyway, it was like it happened in slo-mo; I went down, I vaguely remember the floor guard blowing her whistle, I slid across the floor, and got back up. By the time she'd made it over to me to ask if I was okay, I was already vertical and skating again. It wasn't until I went off the floor to catch my breath that I realized the extent of it - a work colleague of mine asked if I was okay; she was right behind me when I took my fall and commented that it was a really hard hit that I took. I cannot imagine what would have happened had I not had on the knee pads and had I not been taught how to fall."

I waited in the recovery room on my own, feeling a little lonely, anxious, sore, thirsty, worried...just waiting for you to come back. And the corridor outside was busy with people walking up and down, but as your dad brought you to me, I could hear your cry and I never heard it before...but I knew it was you before I saw you...thats just occured to me now! And your dad says that as he carried you to me you were crying, but as soon as you heard my voice you stopped and listened and your face took on a look of wonder...you knew my voice too. And then your dad put you in my arms and OH I will never forget that moment, the happiest of my life...I held you and you gripped my finger and looked up at me with such focus and I just loved every bit of you.

INFP,Yeah when I was in eastern Germany before 1990 when the two halves reunited I could not believe that I'd be living in Ireland now. Things I take for granted like thermostats on the heating elements in the room are not there. The built quality in general is shit. The water is full of chlorine and gives you digestive problems when you drink it. The area is full of litter. Unlike in Germany public waste bins only exist in some spots so people here just drop the packaging when they are done with it. Living here for some time I kind of can filter this out and get used to it. Still I know that things can be done better and are done better in many places in the world. But I feel helpless in doing anything about it. There are so many issues to address  I don't know where to start.

That sounds a lot like the friends I was prefering too. Of course they're both into a lot of different subjects. What i noticed was what is the most prominent/repetative characteristic about them, like one particularly loves music. He plays like 9 instruments and writes music. I understand it's his talent and something he thoroughly enjoys [-whispers- I nicknamed him the music-man]. My other friend does nothing but parkour and gymnastics.

I would love for him to see that fun can come after we work and finish our responsibilities, but is that not reasonable?  Should I allow for quick ""breaks"" during chores, or is it better to have him work toward a specific fun event when he finishes all his work?

As far as I know it's not so much that I do it in expectation of the return gesture, but that, I CAN offer the help now, so I should, because I might need help from them one day.

ESFJ,"In my experience, we ESFJs aren't generally very popular because on the whole, people are uncomfortable around us. We make people uncomfortable for various reasons, but the majority of ESFJs that I know only have a very few close friends, and the rest are pretty surface relationships. People are attracted to us at first, but in my experience, soon drift away because most of us ""cut to the chase"" too quickly on an emotional level. We demand too much emotional energy and commitment for most people. We're not generally good at small talk, we don't generally like anything, especially conversation, to remain on the surface level for very long, and we're not extremely quick thinkers nor are we generally quick-tongued because we experience everything on the emotional level and process our experiences and verbal exchanges through an emotional filter, which takes a lot of time to do. And although we really do enjoy people, we don't understand them very well, because most people will cut off their relationship with us before we have the opportunity to learn very much about them. Again, we delve too deep, too quickly, which makes more people than not, very uncomfortable."

So I think he is actually an ISFP. Isn't Fi-Ni loop often considered to be an existential crisis? Which he clearly has towards the end of the novel."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by enfpeeved   Hello everyone! Do you guys feel like you engage in any sort of emotionally suppressive or avoidant behavior, and if so, could you please describe it? I'm talking about a long term coping mechanism, rather than a method you use to avoid displaying emotions when it's not appropriate. An example of an emotionally suppressive behavior is making a joke out of everything, so that you can't take anything too seriously, and an example of an emotionally avoidant behavior is habitually ending relationships even though there's nothing really wrong, because you don't want to become attached.    No. And I also just stop replying to messages when I think the relationship is over."
ENFP,"- If its an online girl.  Meh , I don't recommend it for a fellow ENTP unless she is close to you ( i.e. somewhat local). LDRs and ENTP just doesn't mesh well in the long run. Everyone is an individual of course but I would say its pretty universal for ENTPs that we feel the need to grow the relationship into new possibilities and the only way to do that is being with the person in real time and exploring those possibilities together. Online limitations only go so far but once that limit is reached we seek more or we start to lose interest. "

My values, traditions, holiday ideals, etc are INCREDIBLY personal and yes, I prefer to maintain them in the way that means the most to me, which is rarely the way my extended family likes it (tonnes of 40+ year old SJ's up in there fucking up my fun).

It's okay to share your feelings and be sensitive to the feelings of others. You can be nice and strong at the same time. It will be easier if my first wish comes true though.

This sounds like a time when your friend really needs to care for herself. I would give your friend assurance that she can rely on you and open up to you with her feelings about what she is going through. If and when she decides to talk about things, don't lecture or give advice or say ""This is what you should do..."" or ""That totally reminds me of a time when I..."" Just be quiet and listen and, for the first time in awhile, allow it to be about her. She will appreciate somebody who is willing to just listen and appreciate her thoughts, without being judgmental.    Thanks for your advice!  Really helps me begin to understand a little more of how she see's things.  It'll be hard to try not saying something because I get so emotional and just wanna give advice or try to relate (which apparently is the opposite of what I should be doing )  I'll do my best to just allow her to feel like she can share with me without the needed pressure of being forced to listen to my advice haha.

INFJ,"An INFJ will let you do almost anything. What you do with that carte blanche says a lot about you. What if you could have it all, never want for anything? What would you do? What would you want? Would you take even more, or would you give back?    I think that our passive nature is not a positive trait. I think when we embrace who we are, trust our inner core, and no longer fear the rejection or need the acceptance of the world around us (the Non NF'ness parts of it) ... We are so amazingly more powerful as people tend to move back as we part the sea of pseudo existence and reveal the fabric of whatever it is that binds us all together. I think it's a balance. I say that one should never be passive until they shove back. It's as bad as the one who is initially pushing. When they push, we stand strong like some crazy Yoda type shit and all Buddha like, shake our heads as we say nothing. It's like the mom who never lays a finger in discipline but rather corrects her children through those words that slice the silence, ""I'm not angry. Just disappointed"" ... I think the passive comes in our fear and self doubt that others love us for who we are. But once we love ourselves for who we are, we realize ... just how loved we have always been."

She's mostly not very verbose so it's a big hard to gauge just what kind of advice she feels she needs. I think she wants to live her life in some kind of authentic/pursuing her passions sort of way, but fears she won't be able to support herself and so tends to drift back to ""boring"" jobs/circumstances - and then that ""drive"" to pursue her passions makes her restless again."

Fi/Ti seem to know this while Fe/Te seem to want to drive themselves to get things done in an objective fashion. One is not better than the other.

The first time I cried in front of my first girlfriend was when we put a baby movie of mine on, and she thought I was fake crying. I feel really bad anytime something makes me realize I've become more callous. So I think it is possible I feel too much and I have to dam it, and it feels like clogged arteries. Either I've become depressed or I idealize the past, because I feel like at some point I had a more nuanced heart, that was kind and could feel everything as a unique sensation, and was understanding and elegant with others, but I've let it atrophy, same with my intellect.

It has happened a few times and it's just a matter of me not knowing he's working that night and not being around my phone constantly on top of my phone being on silent. He doesn't work most nights and he's usually out of the house every night so I never know if he's working or not.

While his position that it's disrespectful is subjective, I understand his thinking. I would tend to also sit quietly, seeing it as appreciating the art form, while not doing anything to demean the artist. The closest example of this I can come up with is --> encountering a street musician playing in front of an open guitar case.  If I enjoyed the performance, I would stop and listen and say,  ""thank you, that was lovely"" when he finished and hand him the money, rather than just walking by and flinging money in the case - a generally accepted form of appreciation - but one I see as disrespectful of both the artist and the artistry."

But they're not just pulling their information from a Facebook JPG, either.  I myself grow a lot of my own food and prefer a farmer's market or local orchards any day over grocery produce, always have, but I don't overthink it and I'm not alarmed by the food supply (it simply tastes much better picked fresh and ripe, and commonsense tells me that it is higher quality than mass-produced stuff picked green). To me, it's just a personal choice.   I've never understood the alarmists who go on and on about food, especially when I ask them if they grow any of their own (you can grow vegetables in 5 gallon buckets if you really want to) and they tell me no.

I started researching pesticide use on wikipedia and I pointed out that they actually keep track of pesticide resistance and take measures to minimize it, such as circulating the type that's used. So yes it is something to be concerned about but saying that pesticide resistance is reversing plants' evolutionary course or whatever, because Monsanto wants to make money, just is a way overreaching claim to me. Anyway, after I pointed out some of the stuff I was reading, she basically went quiet and then changed the topic.

It's hard even for me to imagine what it's like being a homeless man. As a homeless man, you don't have an address where you can collect unemployment checks. You're cut off from virtually all your personal networks of support such as family and friends. Society ostracizes and looks down upon you. Policemen harass you endlessly for simply trying to sleep in public. Psychologically, you're isolated. What makes this worse is America's individualism soaks into the social programs available for the homeless. Even here in liberal SF, there just aren't enough programs out there for giving homeless men and women the job training and the financial resources required to get back into society. As I mentioned before, even when we momentarily forget the mental illnesses many homeless people have, basic necessities such as a permanent shelter and a washing machine for keeping clothes tidy for job interviews just aren't widely available. When you spend years living with the belief that you'll never be able to crawl out of the proverbial pit of worthlessness, it makes you go crazy. "

But I also try to do as much research as possible on, say, their personality type, so that I can see where they are coming from. If I ""retreat,"" it is to seek the missing information (more abstractly perhaps) not to just sit there and get more paranoid. Sometimes to build up the pattern with more connections. Sometimes that is more efficient than dealing with them directly if they still need to figure themselves out."

INTJ,Planning a form of attack on a problem raises the efficiency in finding a solution. Eliminate problems before they happen by outlining possible issues and countering them with solutions. Figure out what you are going to do before you do it. By doing this you save yourself the amount of time that you would waste by trying to figure it out as you go.

I kind of think that the MBTI test she took was a bit flawed in regards to sorting out the difference between being shy and being introverted.  I actually feel as though I haven't really found a real good test to kind of pinpoint whether someone is introverted or extraverted without kind of removing the shy aspects of someone.  I still feel strongly that she is a shy extravert.  That's really my hunch.  I could be wrong, but I just feel like that is the case.  ...or perhaps she is one of these people that are ambiverted and kind of sit in a grey area of the spectrum?"

Many women will say, ""I asked the guy out and it worked out fine,"" but they won't tell you about the things that aren't working in the relationship because they'd be arguing against their point  However, some rare women can pull off pursuing men and kudos to them!

I'm not really christian anymore but I'd still love to do it. I'd love to visit Bhutan someday too.

ISFP,"As a result, when I'm playing tactics heavy fast passed real-time video games, I'll make choices on the basis of what I see as a ""flow of movement through the environment."" I also do this when I play sports. I see the flow of how someone is dribbling the ball down the field and dodging defenders, there is a flow and pattern in the movements, this pattern is recognized unconsciously, watch the way his friend positions himself, my friend is in an intercept position, close off the angle with the person who has the ball and he can't score. No part of that was a conscious thought, just seeing what's going on and intuitively preconsciously recognizing the patterns that it adds up to and reflexively acting on it. There isn't a decision making process in those types of scenarios because there doesn't need to be. Hear the music, feel it through the body, move with it. Go with the flow (in fast passed real-time tactical video games it's kinda like... trying to 'go with the flow' of water through rapids.)"

Im asking with sincere aspect of understanding because i see all this stuff about ESTJs and it contradicts and it feels wrong too. I want the truth and closure so I am asking from the source. I can understand if you feel protective of them but I do mean no harm. You shouldnt be so judgmental of people like that. Its not understanding English because again you assume I know what you mean and what you are talking about.  What does it mean to be good at English in your eyes? Because people have different takes on it. Like I do not even know what ESL means. As an INFP, i think I would not question what I believe in correct? I believe in children and consistency, especially with honor and words. I do not feel a need to question this. Yet here I am questioning these stereotypes that pop in my mind when I hear ESTJ and when I read people's words and on google. Its annoying. SO, I am asking for answers. I can understand how that sentence can mean ""Well i think it is so you should prove to me how it is not."" But I did not mean it that way to which I apologize. If you do not believe me or want to say I am this and that so be it. But I know what I am asking and I really should not have to explain that except to an ESTJ (since the question is directed at them)."

ENFP,"Originally Posted by jsawyerwill   Does answering questions about yourself give you some kind of self-accreditation? if so, do you think its healthy?    Yes, and maybe. I can only answer for me, but I would think that affirming things you already know about yourself has a positive effect on an ENFP's sometimes shaky view of their identity. From what I've noticed, ENFPs tend to look at the bright side of things, so even if answering a question about ourselves makes us face something that we've been avoiding, we can use our understanding of our fault as fuel for improvement. On the other hand, we can also exaggerate how good we are at certain things, which gets worked into Fi and turned into part of our egos. So answering questions is a constant, and an ENFP's reaction is the variable. :)"

If you agree and feel guilty after, the magnet will have caused your compass to north and you will forever have your morality dictate your actions. If you enjoyed yourself, you will be stuck with the compass pointing south and be able to live life without regret. If you stay and cook me breakfast, then you have broken my magnet."
ENTJ,Have you ever thought that it would be a miracle if NTJ couple got pregnant by accident? Their child would be a miracle child!  A real unicorn baby. And if he/she would be INFP she/he would also be a chosen one!  Anyone?    I think the word you're looking for is 'mistake'.
ESFP,"Originally Posted by FeliciteM   Oh no worries, everything I say is just my perspective as well. My older sister is an INFJ and we get along quite well. We lived together for a year and it went pretty well as both of our personalities like harmony and are pretty easy going. When she needs to introvert I am more than happy to have time to myself. The only difference is that she relaxes and reads a book and I spend time by myself exploring a new place that I knew she wouldn't be as interested in. "

ISTP,"Audrey would climb mountains and fight grizzlies to get where I was. Katherine's here in my lap now because I called her over and picked her up. The fact is, I loved Audrey more than Katherine. And Audrey died and Katherine remains. But I don't wish it had been the other way around because no dog should suffer the way Audrey did. And Audrey suffered more than she needed to because she held on for so much longer than she should have. It feels unbearable, how much I miss her."
ESTJ,"Yes, he is quick to get angry, but he blows off quick, too. Once he told me that he had problems being perceived as aggressive and too serious, and said he wanted to be fun and easy-going like my other friends. He liked the control, sure, but this proves (well in my case) that ESTJ's aren't all about power and commanding respect. They wanna have fun too, but they're also serious when they need to be. We talked around and it was clear that he had principles, and that's very admirable. He reached the conclusion that he won't change just because other people wanted him to or because he wanted to be perceived differently. He knows what he is, and he'll stay true to himself."
ENFJ,Originally Posted by freezeframe   Have you considered going to a helping professional?    If your talking about therapy I've already been there for 2 years for severe PTSD depression and anxiety. Gosh. Can I not vent anywhere without being referred to mental help. It's seriously insulting.

INFP,"More meant for the confession thread, which is why it's here, and not in Izzie's thread.    Emotions definitely hinder me also.

If people run away from everything theyll never have a chance to conquer it.    When I think about the lies I have told others it is over things like who I'm with or what I'm doing. You're right that it does not help and it is extremely disrespectful to the person I'm lying to. It creates mistrust and can cause animosity between people. It doesn't feel good and it usually blows up in your face.

Conflict is necessary and healthy and shouldn't be avoided. Learning how to manage conflict is really difficult, but I needed to learn how to face it."

ENFP,As a friend and for more lighthearted conversation and fun - ESFP.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Biliana   That's interesting. INTJ's are also known as masterminds, so it seems as though a quest to find a solution to a given problem would keep you entertained. Do you find that you are bored after all that hard, stimulating work is completed, or just when you are not occupied with an exciting project?    It's when I lack interesting conversation, or when there are no problems to figure out. I get silly when I'm in a situation without any intellectual stimulus, and I'm more or less forced to be in that situation. So I guess it's because I'm not occupied with an exciting project.   "
ISFJ,"...    This very much. To me, being attractive hardly has anything to do with actual appearance. If they're intelligent, funny, kind, then in my opinion they're sexy. If they're ignorant, superficial, harsh, then they're hideous."
ENTJ,"An entj women entered the division where I worked and seemed to take an intense dislike of me.  She was very nice to my face, but in meetings with others would say I was unprofessional, non-empathic to other teams and say my team was lazy and incompetent.  "

And another thing do people really have to spend hundreds of pages writing about something that can be done in ten. "
ISTJ,"- Homophobic hypocrites. Sure, they say they're okay with it and stupid things like that but when they ask questions how you want to live your sex life and how I am attracted to them, I see through their BS.

Everyone loves money.
ESFP,"Anyway, one person suggesting I could be an ENTJ could be mere coincidence, but what isn't a coincidence is that ESFP and ENTJ share functions in a different order, and I have been most happy in my life 'being' an ENTJ, even though I wasn't a 'healthy' one most of the time."

ISFJ,"- you interrupt someone by accident (like you think they're done talking but then they go to talk again, you don't see it, and you start talking, then they sort of stare at you) and then feel like the worst person in the world, and then feel like an asshole until you've reconciled with the person you interrupted"

The only time she's liked and commented my posts is when she's drunk or high. I also get the feeling that she posts things related to me, hoping I will like or comment on it.

ENTJ,"Coming in and telling someone they're mistyped is unnecessarily argumentative.    Perhaps you need your eye's checked, I never said that anyone had mistyped themselves, what I said was that the person didn't seem like an 8 to me, and my reasoning was to do with the offering of a foreign and incomplete model of Enneagram which I am naturally and initially going to skeptical of. To clarify, this is the first time I have been informed by an 8 that they are simultaneously another type as well as an 8. I think I'm well within my rights to be skeptical if I so wish. "

He said he actually didn't have a planned time to end. So of course, I dinged him: there should be no need to cut people off for the sake of time and sacrifice a thorough discussion for a quick one if we never had an end time in mind in the first place. I didn't have any more interruptions after that."
ENFP,I find it very difficult. I talk about relationships here. I seem to have a very hard time dealing with any introverts if its about relationship.

ENTJ,"When you establish art as a discipline in itself, you divest the man from the artist. You stuff him with all the tricks of his trade but his trade is not meant to be self-sustaining! His trade has only as much power as his self. His trade is only as thoughtful, as intelligent, as original, as emotional, as he himself is. On the other hand, the nurse in the hospital can do fine even if he were a robot. Same goes for the doctor. I can imagine having AI lawyers in the future too. But I cannot, can never, imagine an artist, a teacher, or a politician who is programmed, who is hollow deep inside. These are the professions which form our mental atmosphere, and yet these are the professions that we tend to disrespect by considering them self-sustaining professions. They are empty vessels, surely with their own particular shape and carvings which no other vessel has, but nonetheless empty. They are to be filled with something valuable. We have done some justice to teaching and politics, but art still stands unheeded.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by gambino   Yeah, that's more or less what I thought might be the case. Actually, that leads me to another question related to social dynamics: generally, how many of the people in your life are in your life because of this judgement of value/benefit and how many because of a real quality of friendship/knowing this person is enough? Hope this question is clear.    Well if someone is a genuine friend it's because they are very valuable to me. If someone is an acquaintance it's because they are only sometimes and at others maybe even a waste of my time."

INFP,"Today in my anthropology class we were covering race. The teacher put up a picture (that looked pretty recent) of a few guys wearing shirts that said ""white power"" and saluting. They were standing in front of a huge flag with swastikas. I couldn't hear a word the teacher was saying. I just felt sick to my stomach and disturbed inside. I don't understand how people can promote such blatant hatred.. It makes me want to be there so I could run up and tear those signs up in a sobbing blind fury.

ISFP,"I often cannot have deeper conversations with my ISFP because it becomes irritating or tiresome for them very quickly, and I don't know if it's the subject-matter (which she claims) or whether it's actually just this exhaustion where she feels like she doesn't really have time for my hypothetical thoughts and philosophical tangents. I also attempt to console her a lot. When I remind her of my presence and my willingness to support her and be there for her, it helps. Offering her advice on dealing with the things she struggles with is usually shot down as frustrating and unhelpful. Doing the opposite, and merely telling her that I feel bad for her feeling so awfully without offering advice, usually is also shot down as frustrating and unhelpful. In addition, she tends to be irritable a lot, and she can have a temper to her. Does any of this sound familiar or relatable? Sometimes I think I accidentally believe that it's because she has very little care for the sorts of things I think about, and thus that she is ultimately uninterested in my intellectual life, but I also think that she's perhaps so perpetually stressed that spending energy on hypotheticals or things that aren't immediately relevant to her experiences just needlessly exhausts her."

ENFJ,I'm very worried about my brother. He was in a really bad truck accident and they took an hour to cut him out of the truck. Now they are doing surgery on his knees and legs which were pretty much crushed.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Rivulet   If shutting them out  means that I want to retreat and think the whole thing over on my own to decide my proper response to it: yes, I would be naturally inclined to do that. Depending the situation (sometimes an immediate talk is really necessary ) I'll become silent after carefully and with as few words as possible giving my opinion. I'm not against dialogue, but I prefer to do it when I'm calm and understand the situation. If not, I know there's a chance I don't see the whole picture and overreact. I don't shut people out on purpose unless I find them unreasonable or way too pushy. But it is (in my case) never meant as a punishment for the other, but rather a form of self protection, a way to find my inner peace and remain a reasonable person.    In situations like that, where you do retreat and refuse to talk to the person, what's the most helpful response to you?"

Thank you.=)    I am an ENFP and I have done the whole expecting people to comment/like my facebook posts, but I don't do the same for them. Not because I don't like the person, but I'm lazy. Sometimes, I don't even realize that people get upset about it, because I don't view Facebook other social media sites as the barometer for our friendship. When she's high/drunk, you're probably on her mind, which is why she's actively commenting on/liking your posts. I would actually take that a sign that you are on her mind and that she is thinking about you. "

ESTP,ask about his financial situation. It's one thing asking to get married from a safe distance (which actually means nothing)  and holding yourself accountable to that. Pretty sure he's not coming because he doesn't have the money for any of it + projecting hardcore
ISTP,"Originally Posted by barathrum   Yea, turns out you can't just ignore those silly things called emotions [ energy in motion ((wtf?!!?)) ].    No, it is not a matter of me ignoring my emotions. It is that a feeler is projecting their emotions upon me and the only way to communicate effectively is by expressing how I feel about the situation. And such is not a situation where bridges should be burned with a witty put you in your place one liner."

I'm still not sure if that's me getting bored, or if its just inferior Ni wrecking unnecessary havock, but I've found that my feelings for someone are always at their strongest when I feel them pulling away and there's some uncertainty. Again, that's probably a sign of immaturity from me, but the rocky nature of my connection with ESFPs injects the relationships with the adrenaline needed that keeps my feelings for them strong and keeps me from feeling bored.

On one level, it was a little bit of a test for both myself and other people.

Its not just isfps though, i seem to have trouble understanding all SPs.

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Stelliferous   It is the most deceptive emotion - love. You go through life thinking love comes from others and into you, or from you into others. But eventually you will see that the person that you've been wanting to love you all along has been you. Love is not how you feel about others... it is how you feel about yourself. Once you realize this, you want other people to also feel about themselves the way you do. The whole dynamic changes... It stops being about sacrifice and hardship and will power, and becomes all about emotional authenticity, happiness, and peaceful accommodations. Love is truthfully feeling good, not faking it.    This is such a  Si-Fe definition of love haha I like =)"
ENTP,"Your marriage theory? B.S.  If yer single and you aren't love at first sight (not exactly what I want to say), then any get together is going to be serious (not quite right either).  The thing about being married is interest now has no responsibility.  That attracts a certain type of female.  That goes both ways.  I'm married and I find it easier to talk to desirable women because I can cop out.  If I were single I'd probably hide in the closet (well not really).

I have a standing pantry in my kitchen from IKEA with a cracked shelf, because it couldn't support the weight of canned goods. It also has one crooked leg because the bottom panel was drilled incorrectly while manufacturing.

ESFP,"Originally Posted by Fat Bozo   There is nothing in that which says ""definitely not ESFP"" but overall it does have a slightly ENFP feel to it.  My gut feeling is ENFP that has had Sensor parents/family or at least big influences.  I think the main difference is the focus on ideas or learning over the experience itself.  It's not that ESFPs don't enjoy learning, but the experience of people comes first and the ideas second, and it's usually the other way around for ENFPs.    Yeah, that is my dilemma; I do not seem to have any traits that contradict with either personality type to an extreme. Your gut feeling was close: My Mum is an ISFJ an my Dad is an INTP. My other taught me when I was younger and she definitely influenced me more than my father - at a young age at least. However, I would argue that my friends were also a big influence. In Primary school (Grade School) I was friends with a very strong sensor and I mimicked her behaviour to a certain extent (as much as a hyperactive child can) so that I could get along with others as well. However, it didn't work out. Then in High School (Middle School), I was around a bunch of extraverted feelers who were probably sensors as they never seemed to like to discuss abstract matters and appreciated saying the facts. "
ISTJ,"Like OutofAmmo said, lighten up and don't forget that you're a kid too."

ESTP,"You just have things to say, and you don't care if others say something or not, you need to get it out of your head, otherwise you'll go crazy. This is another reason why Extroverts and Introverts do not go together....Extroverts think, if other people aren't expressing themselves by speaking up, then, they don't have anything to say. Not knowing Introverts are still working on that shot of whiskey, trying to get the courage up to say something.  I've got called on so many times for that."
INFP,"So now I'm really on her about it since we absolutely have to get it done. A few hours of dealing with her is worth it to me compared to paying thousands of dollars.

I'm sorry about your cat. :( I'm a cat person, with 2 now, but I wanted a dog. Only the other day, I'd had a dream about having a chihuahua but when I went to the humane society, I wasn't looking for them in particular. But as soon as I saw these two puppies, sisters, I fell in love. I named them Audrey and Katherine. The thing that struck me about Audrey immediately was her absolutely gorgeous green eyes. From the beginning, she was more dependent than her sister. She wanted to be held constantly. She still does, but I should have held her more when she was better. It's heartbreaking now to see that little tail wag as sick as she is. No animal deserves this."

ESTP,"Originally Posted by itsme45   Also, a note, you're wrong with your facts, it's not necessarily insanity. In my country, we have a pretty interesting subgroup of people who live by this entitlement idea. They regularly kill each other. Fun stuff but if a psychologist was to examine these people they would be declared sane just fine.    Indeed, not necessarily. But if you're going to place what I said in a different context it will have a greater chance of being n/a. Sub-groups and cultures aren't even excluded from my definition; it is highlighting the lack of moral restriction or unawareness of the consequences based upon the society in which they exist. I am not calling them insane by default because they kill, and I know they are aware of the consequences. In this case however, rewards aren't only emotional but they may be physical and beneficial instead (particularly in a kill-or-be-killed scenario). If they were taught by their parents or role-models to kill, I would happily forgo their morals as in this case they are non-existent for murder."

ISTJ,Facebook is great when used responsibly.  I have deleted or blocked all of the annoying people and am able to keep in touch with cool people I meet on my travels.  I have this nice collection of people I've met either in person or on the Internet from all over the world.  I really enjoy seeing their pictures and I discover new music...I have bazillions of pictures there but I'm not a 'go get drunk and naked' kinda girl so no worries about some random tagging an inappropriate picture of me somewhere.  And it's good to keep in touch with people I used to work with...I've had several job leads come up because we're in the same industry.  The privacy settings are helpful too because I can block content from anybody I choose....so if I don't want my co-workers seeing pictures from that day I called in sick....I just block them from seeing the photos.  I'm aware of the other privacy risks....but my life really isn't so interesting that it keeps me awake at night.
INFJ,"Nick wants me to shoot the 5K ""zombie survival"" run at the Halloween Festival this year.  Said he'd probably be able to put me up in a motel and all that good stuff, too, if I wanted.

Honestly I can't tell if it's that or just her private nature. Yeah, she confuses me sometimes, and I don't like that. I used to act like that before my Fe really kicked in. Anyways, I sometimes get scared by her behavior and what the future of our friendship could be. I latch onto the negative moments and use that as ""evidence"".

I immediately took over the project, directed everyone else's energy at fixing their small errors and completing the missing parts from the member who did nothing, assembled it from the corrected components using a consistent and attractive style, wrote a killer introduction and submitted it with 20 minutes to spare. I used the remaining 20 minutes to explain to the professor of the course how much better it could have been if the team member who did nothing had even bothered to participate.

The details of the actions help reveal the purpose (consider Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics).  15 compliments were not posted, only 2.  Those 2 were shared to help a newcomer overcome trepidations in a new environment and a small appreciation of things in common.  A third was added in response to an opportunity to make a new friend.  Do these actions ""get a certain post count to exactly 15"" or are they organic interactions in getting to know a new group?  "

He made me join coitillion because ""manners/social skills never go out of style."" He thought I was a weird kid and this would miraculously turn me into a pretty little princess.

He does display a lot of the OUTSIDE stereotypical concepts of an ESTP. He can sometimes say things that are pretty blunt and obvious but really this is just a question if he is feeling or thinking. He sometimes appears really upset when he loses something, I could just be looking too deep (that's why I came to question the ultimate realists). He is very adventurous and definitely has that entrepreneur mentality but I sometimes wonder if that is just a face he puts on. His Dad is definitely xSTP so I wonder sometimes if it's just he feels like he has to be like his Dad or just got that influence somehow.  So my real question is, what do a lot of you do when you happen to get upset about something? Do you sulk or anything like that? I know not every ESTP is the same but I am trying to see if there are any trends here. Sorry I didn't give much info, just trying to get some thoughts on how to determine for sure he is an ESTP. Because he acts it but I feel like he isn't, it could just me being Fi biased.

Obviously important stuff isn't fun but it's a way to distract myself from being upset, and a way to cope."

Literally the only time I can stand being called grumpy is when my 'best' friend calls me grumpy gills, and only because it's from Finding Nemo and because of who it's coming from. I'm about ready to hit one of my friends in the face anyway because I generally feel less enthusiastic about all of my friends during the awkward transition between winter and spring (I don't know why I get any better during spring either because spring is the worst season until it's dry) and I'm just getting sick of people's quirks. Like honestly, everyone considers me a child because I've never worked and I can't drive a car (these may be very related), and I hate that I haven't done those things, but at least I'm not obsessed with 1D to the point that I can't function without getting my doses of them several times daily, and I'm not getting into petty fights through text over relationships like a 15 year old, and I'm not complaining out loud to anyone about things I can't fix.

I used to feel guilty even just thinking about those things but in order to live with myself and not hurt others I've learnt to shut that part down."
ENTP,"@Punniez  ! You INTJs let one of your peers escape from your lunatic asylum, it's "

ESTP,Originally Posted by monemi   Are ESTP's more focused on sex than other types? I don't know. Maybe we're just less shy about what we want.    The estp I know is definitely highly sex focused and not monogamous.  As an ENFP I have a huge drive too..I will bet if an ENFP could stay casual it would make for an explosive coupling!
ENFP,I don't think there should be a person commanding a relationship; there should be equal footing. But I do tend to take control just because no one else wants to. :/

Although Disneyworld, the one in Florida, does have a Florida and Georgia resident discount along with various commercial promotions that cannot be used in conjuction does reduce the price some you still have to drive four - six hours to get there and then you have to wait in line, in the Florida summer sun, go to the park and listen to kids screaming and crying. And then there is the chance that it will rain, in Florida whenever it rains during Hurricane Season you can almost guarantee thunder and lightnining, that basically shut down the entire park."

ISFP,"But other than that I loved my time with her, we would laugh and run around with each other be affectionate. And I don't get that anything was wrong with it. So it's like a slap in the face to say you can't just desire harmony, you have to clearly speak about things. Maybe whoever wrote that article thought that, but maybe they don't know what they're talking about because they don't know what it's like.    Stonewalling, as I've seen it in relationships, is not merely a refusal to communicate, but an attempt to manipulate or force the other person to ""give in."" That's not why I shut down. I shut down when I feel incapable of communicating, but it most frequently happens when I feel I am being completely misunderstood, and worse, that I fear it will get ugly, or it maybe is already ugly, and I can't take it any more.

INFJ,"So, i have this weird fascination with peoples voices. Not particularly singing voices either, it's more I like the sound of some peoples voices, like when they talk, and i dunno. I just like it. Or some voices, hate it. But yeah.. Maybe its because I'm a musician, or I dunno. "

Yes I understand completely what you are saying. I'm still struggling to know when enough is enough trying to help others. I want to see the good and it's hard for me to give up on people undeserving or not. It's a boundaries thing maybe a codapendasy thing with me. I hope to learn eventually. "

ISFP,"Sometimes people ask me why, with my ideas and how passionate I am, I don't try to be an influencer. And truthfully, it's because I don't have the patience to deal with people; neither their egocentric sense of self when they even remotely think they're right about something, or their -- at the same time -- willingness to follow ANY idea that they see getting the most recognition in the world at the time. You can't be an independent thinker and a dependent thinker at the same time. Yet, so many people seem to try anyway. "

ENTP,"Originally Posted by MickyJ1211   I suppose this topic as a whole is pointless simply because it's mostly based on opinion. All of the superhero's have about the same level of badassness and stamina, because they are fictional, and based on how the writer wants the story to end, the level of toughness fluctuates. So there is no real way to determine any valid conclusion for this question.    Plus, even if Batman were to kill Wolverine then some lab somewhere would conveniently have Wolverine's DNA on file and could just clone him as necessary.  Either that or Stan Lee would just hit the proverbial reset button and 'poof' Wolverine would be alive and well again just because. "

ISTJ,"Well, in the past year we made the dishes a chore for someone to do. At first it was because we have a dishwasher. But then our dishwasher broke so we just changed it to by hand. It was rather normal for us, since at our homes the dishes are a chore. If we each owned dishes, we probably would go with washing our own but we share all of the dishes, so you really have to remember which ones you used anyway. I am much more comfortable with the idea of dishes being a house chore than a personal one. I even made a list why, only because I talked to another housemate about my concern and she said to give it a week. Which sounds good as it'll look like I'm trying it out when I've already decided that it's not going to work (it's not exactly like day 1 is superb). So far there are a lot of cons on my list and I have yet to see a pro to her dumb idea except that for the first time that she's actually respecting the chore chart and realized that it would take work, she's decided that it's ""unfair"" to the person with that chore. She said that when she washed the dishes, they were piled up. I don't know what she was expecting, two dishes? It could not have taken her longer than a half hour to wash them all. Something tells me that she never did chores at home. She even had her own bathroom in her house."

I don't believe women can't be abusers, negative people are negative people, regardless of gender. I could think of several occasions when I felt I might have been psyhically abused by one of my exes, so I don't know about society, but I think it's all about the person and how healthy they are. And I totally get the first thing too, when you give a lot and don't receive enough in return, it can be draining, that's why I have some limits to how much I give. I can give alot too in terms of listening to people, being there for them and helping them when they need or just calling them to see how they are. I expect a lot from people too, especially when I have a problem, I expect people to at least care enough to see how I'm doing. In times of trouble you see how many of your friends really are your friends, like I ruptured some ligaments in one of my shoulders, so I'd say this gave me a clear image of how much people love me, like how my parents showed me their support, how my close friends showed me their support and how some not so close friends (more like facebook friends) showed theirs. What works for me in this (and you should try it too) is I don't try to have expectations of people and hey, if they can give back, good, if not, it's still good, I don't really need them in my life, I have a close circle of people (family and friends) who give me the love I need. And of course, I have some limits to how much I give, in order to really go out of my way from someone I must see something in them to make me think they are worth that effort. I'm not saying to close yourself, quite the contrary,, but if you give and you give and they just use you, it will drain you and that's bad because you won't be able to give to those who also deserve it.

I don't know if this is just me or an ESFJ thing but I feel like I keep pretty calm and while I can totally be stubborn too and think I'm right, I'd rather have peace and calm than always be ""right."" In the end, no one truly ""wins"" arguments in a relationship because you still have to live with this person forever so proving that you're ""right"" and being stubborn about it really only drives the other person away....which in the end hurts you because you want to have a good relationship with your partner and not just be the winner and alone. One of the many reasons I try to be careful with my wording during heated arguments is because I know at some point we'll make up again but I don't want to regret the words I've said because I truly love this person and want to have a harmonious family. And to be totally honest, I expect more of myself and slumming it during fights makes me look bad to myself."

ISFP,"Suppose you are much younger, around your late teens and early twenties. Suppose your parents are very critical of you, they do not value your thoughts, feelings, and creative pursuits, and that they often are condescending toward you. Suppose they regularly pressure you with unrealistic expectations, such as attaining a post-secondary degree when you don't have the money to, or having a career when you're just starting out your working life. Suppose that your partner is coming over from another country, and although they're dealing with the immigration part of it, the whole process involves a lot of information, collecting documents, and so forth. Suppose the work you do, while you do enjoy it, is also very physically taxing and you are exhausted a lot. Suppose, due to the years of having your personal creative pursuits rejected by your parents and criticized condescendingly when they're discovered, that you've become very self-conscious about how you appear to be, such that you're confused about what you are really interested in and who you even are as a person. This is the position my ISFP finds herself in, and while she does have moments where she's happy and can have fun, it seems to be fleeting. Rather, she finds herself perpetually bombarded by pressures, expectations, difficult relationships, self-denial, and a worry for the future. How would you likely act and behave on a daily basis?

ENTJ,"If you havent already, get your thyroid, B12 and D levels checked. Low numbers can cause depression. "
INFP,"What do I want from this life?  I want someone to believe that this clueless lump of meat with far more self respect than my appearance conveys is more concerned with their happiness and wellbeing than my own.  Spending money is the only way I know to express appreciation as that's how it's always been in my family, I hate money.  The funniest thing I've done this year was to try and act out emotions - I can act happy, sad, angry... but when it came to acting love I just stood there with a bemused look on my face.  The thing I value most I literally have no idea what it is.  Yet the first person I ""know"" I could make happy is not here.  It's amazing how thousands of miles can accelerate the ascension and fall into a mere couple of days..."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by tnredhead   <...wishes her BFE town had Indian food.    My town didn't, until recently.  Both places are dives (the Indian place used to be the old IHOP building) and RIGHT NEXT door to each other (the Thai place used USED to be the old DQ building).  They're both ALWAYS very crowded during the noon lunch hour, though.  The food is great, despite the exterior appearance of both buildings."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by General Lee   I am tired of being the bad guy for actually enforcing the rules. Today, after I followed school policy in regards to I.D badges, one kid threatened to beat me up unless I removed the record. My response was that if he beat me up he will have an early summer (in my school, if you get sent home for the rest of the year you are NOT promoted to the next grade). I am just tired of having to use that retort.    While I respect your integrity, there's also times when you have to realize that some **** doesn't matter. It's middle school, man. I'm not trying to belittle it or anything, but there are bigger fish to fry, ya know?"
ENFJ,"I love my mum a lot, she is really relaxed and allows us a lot of free room."
INFP,I can tell she has a personality that is just too drastically different from mine... possibly ESTP/ENTP? (I need to do some research...)
ENTP,"So --- in the end, I think everybody is judgemental ------ How much or how little is definitely subjective and can be observed easily."
ISTP,"But in the world of Other People, the Human World, "
ENTJ,"I can assume it has something to do with Te scrapping what isn't concrete and literal, but this would also get in the way of metaphor and syllogistic reasoning. "
INTP,"What am I going to do with my life? Eargh, I took a year off, I work, but I haven't figured out I want to do! This is quite irritating. -_-"
ISFJ,"I am such a control freak, but I wish I did this project by myself because I hate the parts that my group members did and I'm going to have to rewrite them."

ISFP,"With that question asked, I hope you don't mind a follow up: what things do you enjoy discussing most?    Questions of people and humanity in general, perhaps. I observe things about people and I think about the human nature a lot, so that might be it. But really... it's not that definite."
ENTJ,"I rarely get reeeeeally angry, but when I do, it ain't pretty.  "
INTJ,"Originally Posted by TheWaffle   What is the most badass thing you've ever done?    Went to Chicago and Toronto by myself to interview for a job.

I really should start looking for something different."
ENTJ,"And I don't think your friend's problem has anything to do with being a sensor; I'd use Se to reach the same conclusions as you. I find the problem more often stems from whether a person is more interested in abstraction (theories, imagination, ideologies, etc) than the physical world."
ISTJ,Originally Posted by Yardiff Bey   I wasn't meaning to start a debate. I was curious as to why.  And I have to agree with your sentiments re the pharmaceutical companies - greedy ratbags.
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Desthro   I'm still waiting for my questionnaire. It's disappointing to see you wasting your time in such a manner.     Apologies, I got sidetracked.  I am still in the process of tweaking it.  I never give the exact same questionnaire out. I shall pass it to you this weekend if all goes well.  You do not mind it being public, do you?"
INTJ,"@antiant : I see what you did there; I have a tendency to do that as well. It drives some people nuts, but I can't help it."
INFP," I wish I was rich, then I could just get my own place, and get a motorbike and get away from it all."
INFJ,"My brother sent me a text and said Magic Slim is in a Philedelphia hospital... hope he's ok.  My brother... he adores MS... just like he adored MS's brother, Nick (My bro was in Nick's band when he gigged on his own w/o MS)... when Nick died, my bro was absolute gutted.  (Nick's in this video... the bass player on the left of the screen.)  "
ISFJ,Today there was free pizza! And I was starving and have to be here for another 3 hours and had no money. I'm so happy I could cry.
ENTP,"Are ENTP males a natural charmer ? At the least, online."
ISTP,"on the bright side... finals are over, no more classes until the 10th of january.    #hashtagproblems"
ENTP,"-Ob.    Hmmm, lemme carry the 1... and multiply by 0.475.... and add in the number of solstices since our last anniversary...."
INFJ,But...person then turned around and told me something I really needed to hear...I don't know if they knew how spot on it was...but I can't help thinking karma. :)
ENTJ,Step 2: Research the most effective and logical* way to achieve it.
ENTJ,"I never complained. It was just the way things were. But whenever I tried to explain my condition to my teachers, or friends, or...anyone in my very ENTJ matter of fact way I did I'd get so much shit. Even when I was put in group therapy for the express purpose of "" talking about it""-and I very rarely did-was just told to  Shuttup and let the other kids talk."
INTJ,"Identifying with? Sometimes, depends on the context.    It's like I'm reading an academic paper"
ISTP,"Also, I think some guys have a thing for gals in waitress drag. "
ESFJ,"I'm here, I'm an ESFJ and I went to school for Software Engineering. Am I unusual?"
INTP,You can trust me.  No really. I'll make you into a blip. It'll be fun.
INTJ,Also the whole Twilight-Hair the guys had gong was completely out of place and kept pissing me off along with non-period Dialogue.
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by teddy564339   Well, I kind of do the same thing, but it depends on who I'm talking to.  If I really feel comfortable around the person and trust them, I have no problem looking at them all of the time.  But when I'm not, it is easier for me to look them in the eye when they're talking rather than when I'm talking."
ISFP,"1. Sometimes I think I'm a bad person. More accurately, I know that I am a bad person sometimes. A terrible person. But I can't be bothered to fix it. As long as my friends know that I'm not completely terrible, then I'm okay. But I'm afraid that one day I'll become terrible, but to them. Too terrible for them to stick around me. I need to work on that, but I don't know if I want to. "
INFJ,"Although is that just an illusion? Is it all connected? Or are we just meant to believe that random is random? And is there a hidden message in the inane ramblings of a sex-starved, horny, love seeking INFJ male? Who the hell knows?"
INFP,"I love her so much,  but sometimes I feel like I want to shoot her. I want to put a gun to her head so that she won't do anything too stupid and too risky. Seriously, I want to do that to my own best friend. I want to shoot her right now."

Hope no one was offended     Oh no!  Of course not!  What you said wasn't offensive!  *silly!*  I just laughed because it sounded like something my husband would do - and he's the exact opposite of an ESFJ.  ;-)"
ENTJ,"Sorry for going all Socratic on you, its still good information. It's just hard to come up with questions to rate Ni-Se axis in each polar and I'm hoping I can get a solution from you guys.    I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this."
ESFP,"Are ESFP's loyal? In particular, say a girl with many guy friends."
ISFP,"Is there anything I can do to get her back, or make this situation better?"
ISFJ,I got it. so she took it seriously. she wrote the books. He wanted fame
ESTJ,"@TopCatLSD , if he wants ^^    Man, I was a fuckin idiot when I was a kid. My parents used too worry about my health a lot."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by CorgiGirl   I was just wondering, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want too, but what is your relationship with your dad? As much as you should get away from your mother, perhaps it would be unfair to the rest of your family if you left them all without a word? Perhaps you could move and let them know where you moved to, but say that your mother is not allowed to come visit?    My mother rules the house. My mother rules over my father, but he would never ever admit it. He has fought for the little time he has away from her, as well as his freedom. "
INFJ,"to be honest, I respectfully bow out with sincerest apologies if I've offended anyone.    Let's just say, some candidates were worse than others..."
ENTP,What enneagram works best with 2w1? Is there like a table that one can look up in terms of best match?
ISTP,"I can only describe writing on that paper like going into a fully loaded workshop, with ALL THE TOOLS just waiting to be used. Certain inanimate objects are just thrilling. It's like that.    I shall have to give it a whirl."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by reckless summer nights   It's not you, it's me. Or it would be better to say that it's my ENTP ex-boyfriend.  Wait a minute... He wasn't even really my boyfriend. Whatever, I talk too much.    Wow, I feel bad. I think I unintentionally did that to and ENFP once. We were besties, until he told me he liked me.....the second time. :( Anyway, my heart is heavy with empathy for you. Perhaps, one day I will go to the UK and leave a vanilla scented candle on your doorstep. :)"
ENTJ,"We're desirable. But we also don't show our weaknesses well nor are they usually relatable to others, but it is by no means all fun and games."
INFP,"I left Friday to go to work with a friend, then slept over at a friends' house. That morning/afternoon, I went to a party and had fun with friends (as well as realized that i am largely overshadowed by my supposedly good friend. Only one person realized this and acted on it..And I am grateful.) Afterwards, went to work that night. Slept over at a friends' house again. Early that morning, went to work. Got back home, and pulled out my lap top. Then I walked to my room, sat down, and fell asleep (with the laptop charging with everything set up). While asleep, the sun was shining directly through my curtains AND blinds like it wanted to shine on me after the weekend. I needed to recharge."
ISFJ,"D: I hope this relates to others too x__x I just found out I'm a ISFJ so I'm not sure if I fit in here or not, I hope I do! And sorry if any of my answers have already been said, or don't have anything to do with being a ISFJ x_x"
ESTJ,"If my daughter comes home when she's sixteen, looking like a parrot and has a rainbow of haircolor ... I will just assume its just another phase and will say to myself, ""this too will pass."" "
INTJ,"So you probably like instantaneously or irresponsibility versus slurp or plop.

INTJ,What/how many avatars have you had on PerC? How often do you change yours?
ESTP,How many days out of a week do you prefer to see your bf/gf ? Have you ever been jealous/possessive in a relationship ? Are you more calm or energetic 
ISFP,"I hate Christmas, and I'm tired of everyone asking whether or not I participate in celebration. No, I don't want to hang up any decorations. No, I don't want to go to any parties. No, no gifts, nothing. Please let me sleep, or eat Chinese food and watch the same five shitty movies."
ESFP,"What is your favorite childhood memory?    Relationships depend a lot on the seriousness of the relationship. If it is the beginning of a relationship we have no problem breaking it off - on the other hand - if we have been with that person and have invested in them for a long time we have a really hard time breaking it off. We'd rather die inside than leave. I think also, because we see such good in everyone we have a hard time accepting that someone isn't worthy of us. So that generally leaves us in a bad spot. That's been my experience anyways. "
ESTJ,"Completely agree. Especially with the ""irresponsibility"" part."
ISTP,"I'm wondering why people on this site just won't let stupid, bigoted threads die. I mean, it's quite obviously hit the six feet in depth mark; let's start covering it with sand........please?"
ENFP,Sent from my XT907 using Tapatalk    It depends really.
ENTJ,"I've taken the tests, they've told me I'm a 3w4 and an 8. As someone looking to learn more about personality differences I accept the 3w4 and the 8, rather than drawing a giant red 8 on my forehead, and disregarding the other elements of my personality because I think it ""sounds cool"" to be an 8."
INFP,Sometimes I wish I was a INFJ instead of an INFP because I can atleast act the same but without the procrastination because I STILL haven't turn in my college applications.
INFJ,I think the sleeping drugs are finally starting to take effect. Better get ready for bed before I crash

ESTP,"Originally Posted by koalaroo   How doomed am I as an ENTJ with an ESTP?    Actually, probably not that bad. I find communication with EXTJ and ESTP is very good. ENTJ ex's were low conflict and entertaining. ESTP usually take point, but don't have to. I found ENTJ + ESTP was just fine."
ISTP,"And personally, art school has been a long time dream of mine and drawing is definitely something important to me. I only postponed it for so long because I was always told I couldn't do it and honestly, I'm ready to prove them wrong. I think I can handle a bachelor's course, but I'll definitely keep your suggestion to not take on too many classes at once in mind. :)"
ISTP,"Roommates out all night, 5 bottles of ale, netflix, lights out, heaven."
ENTP,"Originally Posted by jamjoint   Yes you can ask for advice here.  Since you seem like a nice person, I'll even forego the sarcasm.  Probably."
ESTJ,"Lots of Si if I was to put it better; very warm and caring, ensuring that the other person is at comfort."
INFP,"Originally Posted by refugee   i wish someone would advise me to slow down instead of speed up, and actually be sympathetic.       I feel you. I'm sorry you couldn't have just that. It's so simple a thing to give, but you almost have to strangle someone to get it."
INFJ,Side note: the monkeysphere comes to mind when thinking of the effects of increasing numbers on this planet.
INTP,Originally Posted by Kilgore Trout   I'll look for it.
ISFP,"Btw, I'm not debating you, I just find this whole cognition stuff frustrating because I don't feel it's all that accurate, either for me or scientifically (no evidence)."
INFJ,I don't know how you just did that. Like honestly... I have no idea. Curse you INFJ for getting that out of me... You were never supposed to have that! Urgh... I feel sick now. All I ask is that you please be gentle with it. Its a lot more fragile than you may think.

ENTP,"Originally Posted by Rivulet   And, what are you passionate about? (On the long term)    Contempory photography. "
ENFJ,"Also, I feel the need to clarify why I find his behavior manipulative. His actions are manipulative because he doesn't want me to take that position because it's in my own best interests; he wants me to take that position because he wants me in that position. And since he knows I don't want the position, he attempts to appeal to my emotions - hoping that I will change my mind due to flattery."
ENTP,Originally Posted by IDontThinkSo   The choice between answering sarcastically or not. I think won't decide myself and let you guess if I'm actually sarcastic.    Tssss.

ENTJ,at which point they just put themselves in my crosshairs.
ENTJ,"The questions I have are about the first situation. When others hold grudges against my SO after a conflict where he holds none, he has a difficult time mending the situation. From his perspective, he just doesn't see why they don't just do as he did and put the situation behind them. Have you all experienced something like this? Do you just let people (even if they were close friends previously) go in these situations without worrying about it or does it bother you to have to do that? Do you attempt to rebuild the relationship? My SO made one paltry (in my perspective) attempt in the recent situation I have in mind and then let the relationship go, even though I think he does really care..."
ISFJ,"You know your an ISFJ when you love spending time with young children as they become more aware of the world, but in a wonderfully innocent way, experiencing the world anew every day, sharing their emotions openly, before the world imposes the need to be serious and not play so much."
ENFJ,"so anyways, i posted a thread in the regular thread spot about this sort of, and my birthday is tomarrow and its going to be soooo sad beause i cant spend time with here, and even if i could i can because i have to do other things. i feel like im in a downward spiral with her and its not getting better, i cant help but be cold to her and that makes her made because she dosnt understand why. thats where the downward spiral is."
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Scarlet.Black   Thank you. :) I like the way things are now. We have our moments but that's all. No offence but I don't see the point of trying to invest in friendships/relationships with EXXPs when we expect totally different things.    Offended, lol :) Immature ENTPs can get offended, but you could tear my entire personality apart and I'd happily take notes. You may not want to be so quick to lump all ExxP's into one useless bucket, but that could just be an INFJ, or your own personal, trait. Expecting totally different things isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are able to understand and accept those differences. It's hard at first, for us too, but it can be interesting... to me anyway."
INFP,"I honestly think I'm ready to move out of my parents' house. Of course, I don't have any money or any way of living. But I'm really ready for that. I love my parents, but they don't let me be and they think I have a problem just because I stay in my room a lot or don't really talk about things with them. I don't really know how to change that..."
ENFJ,"Something so precious and rare, disappeared in thin air.    Eh, I'm a firm believer that you shouldn't regret that stuff. It may have simply served as a cheerful reminder that somebody finds us beautiful and interesting. Others can affirm for us the kind of things we want in a relationship when we do find the right one. "
ESTJ,"- Would you dress in blue jeans and a surfer-type t-shirt in the corporate world? He dresses so casual in a leadership position and it confuses me.    1. No opinion. You may have an easier time typing your boss if you figure out what about the show he likes/what stands out to him. TV show taste isn't the most accurate indicator of type unless there's a very clear ""it appeals to this function"" going on."
ISFJ,"I love my country, but there is little respect for those at the bottom doing all the grunt work for those at the top. I'm tired of us getting involved in wars overseas. We should be working on building each other up instead. We should be helping our neighbors."
INTP,Originally Posted by listentothemountains   I ... have no thoughts.... Ahhh!! *runs away to find some thoughts.*
ENFJ,I wonder if it's possible that I love someone even after 8 years and we didn't date it so much. Kept in touch and even now when we meet it the almost the same........ I can't be that immature and just imagine it. Or maybe I am. :)
ESTP,"However, in my life, people who knows me personally describe me the way a MBTI fan would describe an ESTP. But my colleagues and associates describe me the way a MBTI fan would describe an ENTJ. Stereotypically, i fit more with ESTP except that i don't like sports but my hobbies and skills are very physical(writing, audio-engineering, acting, singing, conference-speaking, debate, politic, journalism, etc)."
ENTJ,I'm the OP.  Here's the first post:      Originally Posted by MsBossyPants   Want to ask us a quick question that isn't covered by an open thread?
ESTP,What's the most subtle thing you did/created this week?
ISFJ,"The man who cleans our office each morning and comes to my cubicle to dump my trash asked me how old I am. I told him I'm 27... because I am. He was pretty much shocked. He said he thought I was 19 and a student or something. This made me smile! In the past, I have found this to be a burden, because I have wanted people to take me more seriously and treat me my age... but now, it doesn't bother me so much. The people who know me, know that I act my age and treat me accordingly. The people who don't know me, don't matter!"
INFP,"anyway, yeah i definitely feel that way, i've noticed that as i've learnt different foreign languages, it's like i can see the world in a whole new way! it's like looking through differently distorted binoculars or something... and that's part of what i love about foreign languages. just as they say, so much can be lost in translation, and sometimes there's really no translation at all. i hadn't thought about it terms of communicating emotion, but i can totally see that, seems true to me. i've heard english really sucks as a language, lol. i'm just glad i didn't have to learn it as a second language, would be a really crappy language to have to learn i think!! though of course english has it's beauty too. "
ENTJ,"Personally, I don't offend people very much, but that's because I mostly hang out with NTs who aren't super easily offended. Then I have more emotional energy to deal with feelers. I think of my ability to deal with other people's emotions as the battery that people usually use to describe introversion- I can deal with it for a limited period of time, but after that, I have to go recharge. Otherwise I get really exhausted and snappy and just want to be alone. "
ENFJ,"I know why I'm here. I've stifled my personality for so long, adjusting to fit a stereotype of perfection. Not just one global view of perfection, but the view of perfection as seen through the eyes of each and every individual person I know."
ESFP,I'll admit that the way how I ended the conversation is a tell-tale of Fi though.
INTP,"I wish I can communicate with inanimate objects, I would love to hear their story."

It helps me see things in a way I didn't before and I also want to hear your own perspective. Not just agreement or disagreement but I like to hear an independent synthesis of everything from whomever I share my thoughts with. "
ISFJ,"Even, ISTJs have more active subforum than ISFJs. Why do you think is that?"

INTP,"Well, I suppose the only thing I find somewhat disappointing is that he's blonde instead of brown... Although I admit hair style matters more to me than hair color.    This is why I love LeaT. I've wanted to say this on here every time someone has mentioned pheremones, but I resisted."

And every time, I picture myself inadvertently saying ""I'm sorry, I don't mean to do that..."" right after they tell me to stop apologizing!  Not as a joke or anything, but as a natural response that just slips out!    I have a friend who got so fed up with me apologizing so much that she finally made a new rule. When I am with her, I am not allowed to say sorry, instead I have to say ""I'm awesome!"""

ESTP,"It's possible he's usin9 you to reassure himself and get him back to his old ways before he was with the INFJ.    Yes, that's spot on. He gave me that song that says ""There's something that I must believe in and it's there when I look in your eyes"" (that's 15 years ago, though). He actually stopped using me long ago (that's why he broke up with me although he didn't want to). I only got back in touch with him recently and on the whole he's treating me like someone who is really important to him (not just as an object). I'm actually willing to help him and it's really easy for me if he let's me do it my way. But he reverts to barking as if I was the INFJ. All those question are directed at a useless object that got off his radar, doesn't get anything done on her own unless he kicks her up the arse every two seconds and can't cope in the real world. "

ISFP,"I can empathise with people and their problems very easily (think of me going, ""That must've been a really tough time for you."") but I find that although I understand a lot of people, they cannot understand me. I ask them questions about their lives but they don't ask me about mine. They're just happy with me being their listener. And when that happens, it shows that they are not interested in my life. With that, I don't go any further than being ""aunt agony"" to them. I don't give myself emotionally and tell them the private goings-on in my life because they haven't passed my friendship test (first stage :p). So I suppose yes, I do find it hard to find the right people to connect with - people who show interest in me for ME and not because I'm a good listener or whatever, and who also are like-minded. Does that answer your question?"
ISFP,"Oh and she's definitely not an ISTJ (she's for sure an introvert). She's not a J, but a P. The I and the P are things she and I agree on, but that's the only thing.

I think she's definitely a Feeler, she's extremely emotional on a daily basis, and she makes decisions based on how she feels not on whether or not she's broke (like she refuses most jobs and will only take jobs based on how she feels about the job morals-wise), and she puts other people's feelings and well-being over her communication, and she is definitely not straight in communication, she'll tell well-intentional lies and pretend that she's fine just because she doesn't want to hurt people's feelings or be disliked or create conflict."

My friend told me that it was no big deal and I said that it might have been my Si, but that I wouldn't have let him off so easily.

The more the candidates screech, are outlandish and are media-driven, the more people seem to be swayed.  The principles of governing are my concern more than the showmanship of the candidate anyway.  For example, the car discussion above:  I don't think the government should be in the business of telling us what we should drive to begin with.  Their job is to govern and uphold law, not to mold our society into a homogeneous urban culture that they cannot see beyond.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by 501st   Multiple-choice question: Let's say that you are driving down an old dirt road of a tall woods in the middle of a late autumn to reach your private getaway, a large cabin, for the weekend with your date. You and your date have been dating for quite a while now and you're both enthusiastic about spending alone time with one another. As a matter of fact your date is in extremely high spirits, and even as you are entering the small property and unpacking what few items you've brought they are chatting away about what they've been planning with you. Soon it gets late however, and the tall trees around you make it impossible to see far enough into the woods so you retreat back inside to drink beverages, silly recordings, and enjoy oneanother's company. Later in the evening, while you and your date are relaxing, you both begin hearing tapping coming from behind a nearby wall. You and your date are scarred, and you get yourself up to go investigate. Before you leave, you pick up a heavy, 35 watt flash light so you can see into the foggy darkness. quelling your fears, you exit the cabin and search around for the source of the disturbance. Carefully you make your way around to the back of the cabin, but are disconcerted by the lack of evidence that anything was anywhere near the cabin wall. Still a little uneasy you turn around to return indoors when your light catches a sadistic, pale looking clown with jagged teeth approaching you and breathing heavily. You scream and drop your flash light before running off into the pitch black woods. You soon see rays of light shinning at your back and your realize that the clown has picked up your flashlight and is chasing you. The clown chases you pretty far before you trip onto the damp soil. Thinking quickly, you spot a conveniently placed hiding spot and decide to crouch yourself behind a brush. Soon the clown catches up to you. He is breathing heavily and cackling demonically, and is searching for you with the large, bright beam. The clown continues cackling, gargling and searching for you for the next 4 minutes, and the only way you manage to remain hidden is by staying completely still. But now the flash light was on you, and it wasn't making any movements at all other than the strange twitches of the thing holding it. Then suddenly the light jerks away from you, and you begin hearing your date calling out for you. The light flashes your way one last time before the clown leaves, breathing heavily again. Nervously, you pull yourself up out your hiding spot and take a few deep breaths. It is still impossibly dark, but you are able to tell where you are relative to the cabin as long as your date keeps calling out for you. You are also aware that the daemon clown now searches for your date, and will chase after them if it reaches them."

At the end of the school year I see lots of parents trying to sell back that instrument because their child lost interest (which happens frequently once they find out how much work and dedication it takes) Then the parents are shocked at how low the buy-back is

I have this strong tendency to let  my Ni lead me off on a wild goose chase; I might come up with an idea that 'clicks' with me so deeply that I just refuse to let it go  and then I engage on a stubborn quest to prove it to everyone I know in  order to prove it to myself.

In fact, it took a few weeks before I actually started being attracted towards him.

Oh! I have experience with that! I've recently been told that the reason people wont share their innermost thoughts with me is that I never tell them things about myself unless directly asked. It makes them feel like I'm secretive and they don't really know me. They find the never ending questions flattering, but don't want to share the really important answerers with a stranger. (I tried to tell them that if they just asked me questions, they could get to know me, but apparently that just does not compute with feeling types.)

I don't remember facts or specifics, but what I have been able to hold together are those weird intertwingling things that one sees. I have eventually realized there were patterns to behaviors and patterns in interactions and relationships. I observed relationships that worked well, and others that didn't. I have paid attention to my own relationships, and all these years, like I said, patterns emerged over time. One day, about three years ago, I discovered MBTI, and the more I learned, the more I realized that so much of what I've observed over the years, and seen--those patterns, etc. all made sense. My inferior grip experiences (rather lengthly, to be honest), the inter-type issues, especially with my coworker/partner and also with my wife, kids, etc. What I find fascinating about all this is that it gives me a vocabulary and a structure to wrap those observations in--an ability to express things only marginally understood, but long observed, and now, much better understood.

That, and the fact that I'm unable to overcome the 'don't talk to me' thing because I can't help taking it as an injunction.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by chicanai   Thank you for helping me remember that it's okay to be our true selves. Sometimes, I forget that I shouldn't try to please people too much - at least not at the expense of myself. By the way, if you don't mind, do you mind sharing your enneagram? You seem outspoken (from that one post alone) so you've tickled my curiosity. If you'd like to keep that private, that's fine, too. I'm a 2w3.    I tend to be a people-pleaser as well, and yet when I feel or think something strongly, I'm usually not afraid to share it. In that sense, I suppose I am outspoken. To be honest, I don't yet know what I think about the enneagram; from what I've read, it doesn't seem to be backed up scientifically like MBTI, and I definitely have a different view when it comes to energy and chakras and that sort of thing. Nevertheless, I took two tests and seem to come out as a 9w1 SP. I read the descriptions and they seem to describe me pretty well, though I think it may be over-generalized. Hope that helps!"
ISFP,"Math and science were two subjects that never interested me much, so I would offer kids practical hands-on learning opportunities that have a tangible result. Example: teaching radius/circumference by showing them how to cut fabric to sew clothes. We love animals and nature, so planting a garden or raising small creatures would be great. If the lesson feels too abstract and pointless, we check out."

ESFP,"Thanks so much! :)    In the beginning of a relationship, no matter how much the ESFP ""loves"" someone, it is easy for them to break it off because they won't stay if it isn't going the way they wanted. On the other hand, if its a long time relationship it is VERY difficult for an ESFP to break it off because they are deeply attached to that person. ESFP's in their own way and like everyone need closure after a break up. As for staying friends after a relationship, that depends on the specifics."

Almost as if a high-energy display of nosiness from me would be the only way to protect them from feeling hurt. (????) Further, my hesitance to respond gushingly to the high energy stream of a million questions to me is similarly offensive to them somehow. (???) Of course I have always been stunned and baffled by this, and I don't know if it has to do with personality type, or poor boundaries or manners, or the specific insecurities of a few dozen specific people I've met over the years.

I don't seek out a friendship with them, but they kind of latch on to me as friends. It's never very overt, but I've had a few INTJs friends over the years, and the friendships are the sort that are... well, quiet, with the occasional ""argument"" over theory or something, but not what I'd call dynamic, like with my SJ friends (dynamic not always being a good thing). Ironically, my most ""dynamic"" relationships have been with ENTJs, but despite the ""dynamic""ness of those relationships, there were never hard feelings or hurt feelings. We can argue and fight and insult, etc. but neither party ever feels offended. I don't think I could say that re: INTJs. I have found it possible to hurt their feelings and offend them--never intentionally, and even in the face of my attempts to not to. It's not frequent, but it has happened a couple times. One time, it was pretty much a permanent cutting off on his part. "

This is a good thing in many aspects, but it sucks in romantic relationships when the other person does not see the potential that we see, or does not have the guts to turn that potential into reality.  Or sometimes they simply do not feel the same way about us that we feel about them.  The ability to see ""what could be"" works against us in romance because we only have control of one part of it, and I think it's safe to say that some of us can get caught up in the vision of it rather than the limitations of the reality.  When that happens to me, I have to rationalize it, step back from it and look at it objectively.  It's a process, and not a fun one."

I, too, can handle emotions; however, it is very taxing on me and I cannot and will not face too much of it.

Telling her that I don't see things in black and white like that... that I am smart enough to know there are always two sides to any conflict... and that I don't think she is a bad person... doesn't really have much effect on her.

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Ancient   I do, too. I have to admit, though, when it comes time to drag feelings out of me, the ones easiest to reach are the negative ones. The way I express my positive emotions is too often like that of a male youth and not a mature adult."
ESTP,raichu-i was going to kiss my hand but make it look like i'm kissing you..ok?snob!   :)
ESTJ,"Also, I'm considering moving out without telling her after I graduate, so it's basically ""running away"" lol. So just wondering how would she react? And will she ever forgive me? Will she be hurt?"
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Jawz   You've already shown us that you've got a lot to offer. But there's no harm in these doubts - they give courage - and with fear, there's always ways to fight the fear. It will feel like it will consume you, but there's always a glimmer of hope - a feeling that surpasses the fear itself. These feelings add to your character - in time, they will give you a sense of self-belief and resolve - and you'll be greater than you know. You have the ability to be great in you - even though you doubt it and you probably will doubt it - doesn't mean it doesn't exist. "

INFP,Also thinking about how I'm not the girl that any guy falls for I know blah blah your going to diagree and insert something nice
INTJ,There are 85% of people in the world that will bring nothing to the table (my table that is).
ISTP,"Though the interviewer was this kind of goofy sexy so ill let everyone else be the judge.    I am not going to make a joke or innuendo including the phrase ""nailed it"". But it may have crossed my mind. Also, kinda cute, in an exhibitionist sort of way."
INFJ,I think this day is done. I feel like going back to bed and wake up tomorrow.
ISTJ,"Is this the rommate who made your ex-ISFJ roommate moved out?    No, she's gone now. Although oddly, I preferred her over this girl. My reasons (since that housemate was a huge jerk as well)? 1. This girl wouldn't try to take control of a situation in the house that she had put zero effort in. 2. A majority of the conversations I had with her were intelligent, 3. She didn't talk about herself all the time."
ISTP,"Which, I'm currently dealing with emotions because my Grandpa is one of only three people of my entire extended (both sides) that I give a damn about. Guy was a badass. WWII veteran. Anyway, I found out that his pacemaker's battery died and he isn't getting it replaced. I'm suppose to be going home in April, but I'm scared shitless that I won't make it in time. I'm afraid he'll never get to meet Bug."

ISTJ,@sRae ?    Urm... the avatars have been glitching or something lately because multiple users have been incorrect then changed not long after.
ESFP,"Milkshakes, be direct. Tell your friend, you think he might like this girl, and out of respect for both of them you're intervening to say he needs to let it go."
ISTJ,"Enough is enough. The gloves are coming off. I'll still keep the mask on for special occasions, but it otherwise gets hung up."
ISFJ,"Do you find that your memory of events may not always line up with others' memories of the same event due to your attached emotional connection to them or that may in some way be tied to your tertiary Ti? Or perhaps you remember the same course of events but you put greater emphasis on some different aspect of the event based on what your Si picked up on?    Yep, I'm not sure what function it's tied to, but I definitely get the sense that my perception of past events is different compared to how other people view them. I focus on feelings and thoughts, but maybe that process is very focused on either one person or a small group of people? And what I remember is usually fragments of conversations rather than the whole thing (sequence)."
INFP,emotions and jealousy wouldn't of gotten in the way and his inability to admit any jealousy.
ISTP,"I have little patience also, and having people in my face all the time, it's impossible to hide that side of my personality. I can usually hide it/it doesn't surface if I'm with people in short bursts or I can get away and get some silence or space."
ISFJ,"Thank You for feedback. DYK Facebook used to be called The Facebook until someone recommended a slight change in name? Sometimes the little things make a big difference.    Depends on what it's about. A saga has to involve heroic achievements and a story is just a story, regardless of heroism or no heroism."
INTJ,"@Ormazd  in that I wouldn't find it weird because I would tend to do the same thing. However, I don't know how an ENFP would feel about it. They may be more likely to find it weird than an INTJ."

ISFJ,-even constructive criticism hurts - Checked - Because they can't see what I was aiming to...
ISTJ,I was just saying your example of a group project reminded me about one of my group members.
ENFP,"But generally speaking, I'm not very annoyed by things. But meanness and unwarranted criticisms are seriously annoying."
ISTP,"Look, I get you want me to join you on your ego trip/meltdown, but you can file that under ""stuff that's not gonna happen."" I don't have any interest in getting on a drama queen's wavelength or being swept away by stupid."
INFJ,"I'm going to a private music lesson. You're all going to be jealous, because my teacher is incredibly cute."
ISTJ,"I met this guy in college (I play the guitar, he plays the bass). He's one of my best friends, we've known each other for 7+ years now. The only problem I ever had with him was how he'd show up 20-30 minutes late to see me. It drove me nuts.  "

It can take 6 months to a year for me to put something behind me sometimes which is draining and as I don't like looking back too much (and evidently I get stuck in ruts at times of stress, not learning from the same mistakes and doing unhealthy random things)."
ISFP,"And that for someone to begin that journey I'd need an exterior behavior more appealing to the kind of person I would like to like me, and I would think would like me."
ENFJ,"At the same time I want to emotionally disentangle myself from others and stop feeling their feelings in order to start functioning for myself, but then I realize that that's the last remaining connection I have to life and the last real symbol of my being. If I lose my ability to feel others' pain then that means that I've truly lost my way and my purpose. "
INFP,"Yeah, people tell me I'm too idealistic, I know I am.  It is my burden, my pain, my lonely road."

ISFP,"Unlike what many analyses say, we had a lot in common, liking a lot of the same movies/music, many mutual friends (I was already and considering the circumstances, still am very good friends with a lot of her friends, and all of my friends really liked her), and were in about the same place in life I'm a sophomore, she is a Jr but is taking this semester off to work. Right now we live about 5-10 minutes away from each other."

I would call it more ""training"" than manipulation maybe. And anyone is subject to this. I have a neuroscientist friend, and she explained me how the conditioning works. (There is a wiki page, it is called respondent conditioning or classical conditioning.)    Oh, well this is definitely not what I expected. How do you experience him doing that? Do you think it's with good or bad intention?"
ESFJ,"Originally Posted by BlondeRJ   I married an INTP as well.

INFJ,Originally Posted by Ningsta Kitty   I share too much. But have so much I don't. Sometimes it feels a little crowded in here. Of all the people I once was ... And the dreams of those I've yet to become. I wish I wasn't so awkward sometimes. My life is so interesting because I'm an idiot :p

INFP,"Today I had my first embarrassing Fi overload/breakdown in front of someone in a long time. I friggin' burst into tears in my volunteer coordinator's office. My mother had just moments before mentioned the possibility of divorcing my father, and the realization of it hit suddenly. Dammit. Just dammit."
INFP,"Ugh, feel like such an angst bag for posting those lyrics. Whatever."
INFJ,Thank goodness for that bit of lycra/spandex in skinny jeans.
ESTP,how often do you find yourself thinking one thing and saying another just for the sake of appearances?
ESFP,"He's also more interested in general systems than I am, like how cars function - though that's a stereotypical example. He tends to want to learn all about something so he can solve problems by knowing how the entirety of the system works. You can miss me with that shit, that's way too time-consuming for me. If I need to solve a problem, I'm probably going to consult just the right person to get it done, or learn the bare minimum to cover it. That's another difference - ESFPs are more likely to use their human resources (ask someone) when they need to figure something out. ESTPs can be more self-reliant in that regard. Te also differs from Ti in that way; Te-users only give a shit about what is currently relevant to getting what they want in a given situation."
ENTJ,"- Is there a negative cumulative effect that undermines your commitment to someone? eg. if your loved one has issues that come up periodically, does it start to tax you to the point where you might walk away."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by daleks_exterminate   Which one, sparky pants?    I guess both are so sparkling I got my Ti blinded"
INFP,"I don't know, I guess I've always assumed that no one would be attracted to me - first because of my looks and then because I'm such a strange, unconventional person. Like when someone gets to know me, they would realize the facade of normality I exude at first is just that, a complete facade and nobody would want to deal with someone so weird (as a friend yes, but not as someone they could be interested in)."
ENTJ,Example 2: An INFP who wants to pursue a career in music but who hates networking and schmoozing with others in the industry so won't suck it up and do it to get a foot in the door.
ENTJ,"So try to look at his interest level like:  ""this thing"">""that thing"">END RESULT.  Speaking for myself, it is the quickest way to raise interest.   Long conversations can be held over ""this thing"" and ""that thing,"" but only if there is a chain to explore, rather than just some unresolved abstract concept that goes nowhere.    Ahhh okay. But I ultimately just wanted his opinion on what it was since he knew it was a dead animal. Cuz it tasted like one. He then told me he didnt want to say because he did not want to be wrong. I told him that tells me you are afraid to but I see what you mean here. He didnt want to give false info and he said that. But again i dont see a big deal in that. An opinion is not a fact."
ENFJ,"I fucking hate people with this form of herd mentality. Makes me wanna fire a shotgun in the air or at someone's face there. Again, kudos for the teacher for even not hitting one of them. Man was doing his job, safe and simple and it was also his duty to protect the kids... "
INTJ,No action leads to the default outcome: extinction of mankind.    Unavoidable circumstances make you choose between extinction of mankind and pedophilia? Get real. 
ISFJ,"2. Went to a bar for the first time: happy hour, crowded, dim, clumsily knocked over my drink, hate the taste of alcohol, didn't drink enough to feel any different, friend got too drunk and crazy, learned way too much information about a couple we know, don't like that environment."
ISTJ,There are people who are a 'super-race' and they actually can survive perfectly well on 4-5 hours sleep/night. I heard about some studies they were doing with them to try and work out which gene this is cause it heritable. I'll try and look it up when I have some time.
INFJ,I always wonder what kind of guy I will end up truly falling for and committing to. There are so many fish out there that I like but which one will jump into my boat? The thought of being pounced on scares me. Nevermind.
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Fynest One   I usually don't initiate holding hands with someone, don't like to cuddle for too long, I don't like kissing. If I'm talking to someone, I refrain from reaching out and touching their arm, shoulder etc. If someone is sitting too close to me, I get a little bothered lol. That sorta stuff.     "
ISTP,"I very, extremely, rarely ever empathize with characters. But, I watched The World's End last night, and there's a monologue close to the end that made me incredibly depressed because I have felt that way for a long, long time. And hearing the words spoken aloud just made it that much worse for me."
ENTP,I even had a 'type me' topic here that I answered bunch of questions but I'm afraid my ennegram will never be found for real. 
ENFP,But most people are not NATURAL in reading others and that's ok
ENFP,"That's why I asked about ENFPs and diets.  I know I'm bad at them, and thought it might have something to do with resolution, ENFP-ness, and all that jazz.  Guess I wasn't that far off, but somehow, that doesn't make me feel better.     "
ESTP,"And good, I don't have to change his type. I was a bit worried ESTPs didn't ever bottle their emotions. Yes, my character's emotions show on his face but it takes his parents a long time to get them out of him (he explodes with anger in that scene but soon controls it)."
ESFP,"I really don't mind objective criticism.  Just make sure it's accurate, and not petty."
INFJ,"Also, I either have allergies or a cold, and it sucks."
INFJ,"Of ALL the threads I've thrown up that have bombed, I'm a little surprised to see so little attention paid to the autism awareness thread. Interesting. I've had more likes in 5 minutes from redundant posts than I have in the last 5 hours for the thread I live every day. "
ISFP,"The only thing is, it's a longer wait, to get with someone like that, and it's good to keep working on yourself, so that you are who you would like to be, and when you come across him, so you feel like you have what to offer. If you want someone who you could truly desire, you have to be in a situation in life, where you feel it's perfectly valid for him to desire you.    "
INFJ,"I also hate when people start acting sketchy... it takes very little for me to door slam somebody these days.  Any bit of flakey, nosey, clingy, controlling, unreliability, whatever... and I'm out.  (Or, more correctly, they're out)  "
ESFP,"Originally Posted by FeliciteM   I'd definitely be around them and let them know that they aren't alone with what they are dealing with. Depending on how much information I know on what is bothering them, I'd try different things. If it was a bad day, I'd cheer them up by things like favourite dishes, teasing them, massage, or just listening to them vent if that's what they needed. If it was a more serious matter then I would approach it differently. It's hard to pinpoint it as everyone is different with how they react to me when they are in a bad emotional state. "
ENFP,"Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk    This is usually like this with everything anyway, but when in love, it's like my imagination takes some ecstasy pills and go on rave mode ! It's intense, all the time, craziness.... and leaves me with a very dry mouth afterwards"

ENTJ,"My overall two cents on the situtation?  I think @furryfury provided you with some spot-on observations and some good advice, but my approach is usally less focused on MBTI typing and more on the individual, or as I like to say, ""MBTI typing aside, sometimes an asshole is just an asshole."". It becomes less about:  ""how do you react to an XXXX in the grip of ... "", and more about ""how do you deal with someone who is just being difficult?""  You call them out for being an asshole.  Of course, you have to clean that up and offer the opinion in a more palatable way, but clearly this guy is difficult to work with and should be called out for it. "

ESFP,"Originally Posted by Memory of Talon   Yes I say I love you all the time to my platonic friends. Male or Female.

I was wondering whether ESFPs put something else in those words. If I say 'I love you' to a friend, that friend must mean the world to me, and if an ESFP says 'I love you', I get the feeling it's a variation of 'I liked hanging out with you today a lot' :D Hence, I asked."
INTJ," Yes, i suppose you have a point. As i said it was noted here by observers, not written in text. I would have to agree with this observation, as i've been really watching . Although there is no way to say this is truth, or fact, from what i read, and see here at PerC it seems ENFP are less emotional of the feeler family . These observations were measured with how ENFP express themselves, maybe during confrontations, debates, everyday expression, by me and other members, for fun only of course. With that being said without a doubt we have a few lingering cry babies.These observations were among the intuitive feelers only"
INTJ,"The Protestant work ethic has a lot to friggen answer for IMO.  8 hours sleep, 8 hour work 8 hour play.  In reality the 8 hours sleep and play is eaten into and evolving around the 8 hours that you are supposed to be working.  Commuters spend up to 4 hours getting to and from work.  Time hunting and gathering food to feed thineself takes up another 2 hours if you are going to supermarket and preparing food yourself. So there is 6 hours already taken from the play or sleep allocated time. For those who shift work their health deteriorates over time as the constant shifting in circadian rhythms ensures that they are more susceptible to developing illnesses in areas they are predisposed to, thus shortening their lifespan considerably.  They make (in Aus) it impossible for one worker in the family to be able to afford to buy new homes.  Two wages are needed.  So women or men (usually women) are forced into juggling jobs, housework, children etc and usually are forced into the lower earning wage bracket. For these people the work never ends...there is never going to be adequate pay for what they do."
INTP,"It's obviously a different matter for the people who are actually going in the exact direction they want to be going, but what about the vast majority of people who just do things because they have to (not because theywant to). WHY BE SO SERIOUS IF YOU DON'T EVEN REALLY WANT TO BE DOING IT?!"

ISTJ,"I realise I am probably one of the worst people to say this, since I happen to have very little experience in interviews itself, but I still have read quite a few books on the topic. The trick as I understood it was that for an interviewer, you are all apples. He/She wants to pick the best apple. How does he do that? By getting to know you. The thing is most people seem to think that interviewers are sitting there with a 'right' answer in their head and you just have to guess and say what you think they will like. "

ENTP,"Also, do you ENTPs feel like you get along especially well with us ENFJs?    When ENTPs are accepted into Hogwarts, the first thing we inevitably learn how to make is a love potion. Every time we encounter an ENFJ, we use their weakness, love, to conquer and destroy them."

I feel connection to him as well now, but there isn't any outlet for people to talk. There are a lot of people who experience extreme pain like this, so I don't actually understand why people cannot talk about it. I'll listen here online or in message if it ever helps you. My own life is a bit chaotic, so my replies may be erratic, but if it helps to type it out, I'm here and able to listen. :)"
ISTP,"Also I honestly don't believe that you would actually stay calm and try to reassure the person like that in a situation like this. It's easy to think that you could but until you experience it I don't think you can truly know how you will react to something like this. Adrenaline alone would probably throw off your whole thinking process, never mind that you might still not fully know what kind of damage has happened to your car or yourself. Plus I think she knows what happened, and I never did find out exactly what happened, whether she was texting her BF or if her mind went into a soft focus. I just thought it was kind of odd that she noted a glare since it didn't feel like I was glaring. I felt I was trying to be fair in that what has happened did and now how do we move forward with the legal and official matters?    I agree, adrenaline is some crazy shit, once it gets released."

INFP,"Hopefully that cleared at least some of the misunderstanding up.    It actually did my comments are not based on MBTI or it's definition of thinking and feeling, (feeling is just another type of thinking so the labels are inaccurate, misleading and foolish.) my definitions are based on articles and books on the topic of cognitive science I have read. As well as a life time, of trying to understand people, and the world. Both in an intensive quest to in some way understand myself and conquer whatever demons remain in me to be the type of person I want to be. I think that making a decision based sole on emotion is a truly bad way to make decisions. I also think that no decision is ever made using thinking. Thinking only disqualifies options it does not produce them. (One of the reasons feelers are so much more positive about things and people. They create stuff, and often get cynical and set in their ways when someone says that it isn't of merit. They often then become thinkers or alienate themselves from criticism, with an attitude of you can't say my feelings aren't right because you can't truly prove anythings not right.) Feeling and the subconscious are interlinked, they create things, (By create I in no way mean actually create from nothingness I mean re-shape.) give explanations and connect the dots. Reason points out when something is wrong, that's the conscious' gift to humanity. I identify myself as INFP not because the tests tell me so, it's because I relate holy and completely in my core values and beliefs with what is important to them. My interest in people makes me an INFP, my obsession with mastering myself, questioning myself, and treating the world with an even minded compassion. The INFP is the epitome of a person who seeks honor in their person and does their best in the world for every one they can. I was born an INFP, I grew up an INFP, I adapted to life. Now I always, and I mean always make sure to see if whatever crazy crap my brain comes up with is thoroughly tested by reason. I think everyone else should as well, in order to allow their creativity to take it's full and ultimate shape. "

I am quite honestly lost in a torrent of ideas now that I cannot completely respond to this. I do believe that they are thinking but you strike a point in that why would they always ask us other-wise. I don't believe it's so much an opposite, or truly a form of thinking in the sense of MBTI and in our minds. While we consider the analyzing of our feelings to discover how deep they truly are, maybe they don't truly consider it ""Thinking"" maybe they see it as it says, ""feeling"" the extent of their emotions. While it makes sense to us to call it a form of thinking, maybe it does not to them. I am lost in this conundrum. If you could follow my thoughts, I applaud you, for I can barely do so."

INFP,I guess that sums it up. Since it's a process it cannot be pure since it's always changing and evolving. So you have to be on your toes and go with the flow. Dreaming about it is nice but then you are stuck in the past or possible future but not the present where the process actually happens.

ESFP,"Originally Posted by nO_d3N1AL   What is your opinion on NTs in general? Do you find them to be fascinating and interesting people in their own way but difficult to understand and interact with, or just plain boring nerds? I find myself attracted to ESFPs for some reason, yet I am the complete opposite of one! I'm just wondering how we come across to you. Is being quiet, reserved, shy, rational, not outwardly emotional and ""serious"" attractive/intriguing or do you have the opinion that we should stick to being abstract, lonely and philosophical?    At least generally speaking I get along with NTs very well as long as they don't take a condescending tone.  I don't mind being corrected by them and I love their unique, insightful, matter of fact perspective.  To be honest I don't find the things you think about as too abstract to be out of touch because of the way you talk and think about them.  I think NTs should be more confident (well the ones that aren't...the ones that are over confident and think they are smarter than they are annoy me to no end) because their view is one more people need to hear as long as they realize that other people's perspectives are valuable too."

ESTP,"Originally Posted by pwowq   I ask for opinions and what about ""it"".

There is a spot with a bunch of rocks and such that go a few meters down, right to the water. Well, I found a big rock and sat so I was right level with the water. It has been a beautiful, cloudy day here and the sky was just huge and gray. It was starting to rain, and as the raindrops started hitting the water, it looked as though the lake were sparkling and I was right in the middle of it.

You get this reputation (a wrong one, I think) for not liking sex, and yet you have such an attractive personality.    As several other people have already said, it's mostly just the aloofness that makes us seem sexy. The uninterested demeanor attracts people who want a challenge, I guess. Usually, the unintentionally cold rejections or not acknowledging of the other person's interest makes them leave us soon after meeting us though.

ISFJ,"ISFJ's are a wonderful group of people. While you internalise too much and you worry too much, you are the ones that are often very genuine and very often genuinely care. You understand feelings very well and empathise very strongly but sometimes have difficulty realising that the emotions you think others have are not what they really do have. "
ENFP,"As far as the E or I, you could just be borderline in between. Here's the main question that decides it all, where does your energy come from? No, I don't mean sleep and food. An extrovert can spend an extended amount of time around people socializing and walk away feeling very energized. People 'fuel' them. They get excited and want to talk about what happened to them/how their day went etc. An Introvert gets their energy from being alone. They take 'me time' and come back totally energized and ready to take on the world. Socializing takes up their energy, instead of giving it. No one is 100% I or E. There are times when I need 'me time', but I have a very high E percentage, so my 'me time' consists of watching television while texting (a more toned down version of socializing) or going to the book store with a close friend (low-key zero stress socializing). A Introvert wouldn't see those things as energy-giving at all. In order to get energy, they need to go the book store alone or watch a movie while not texting. I hope this helped you realize your I or E."
ENTJ,"If you look at Neo-Nazism, you will see that they express their eugenic beliefs as scientific to gain an upper-hand and attract skeptical attention.

INFP,"I just want for this unceasing pain to just stop already, for it to evade me so that I can emerge past my own shell and visualize this world of mine in the quiet manner I wish to, and yet in spite of endlessly relfecting on my own self and ways in which I will truly be able to bloom and prosper onward, I still find myself lying atop the same rigid floors lacking in genuine warmth and faith. I can never seem to reach the overlaying sun that resides beyond myvenneered windows, for all I can see is a stilled night of labyrinth in which I can't even visualize but one star to which I can truly direct my wish towards. I long depserately to somehow identify that one special person whom will walk the journey of change along my side, and yet that being theirself seems to still be unable of being deciphered amidst this vast world consumed by persons whom still have yet to visualzie the true anima that lies within my heart."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by furryfury   I am not in touch with my feelings at all.

Other times I don't feel anything, like breakups or if I should empathize with someone. "

I wonder why is it that I always seem to look better in the mirror than I do on film? I hate seeing my face in photos. Why do I see myself like this!? Why am I torturing myself like this!? *sighs* I've lost 50 friggin' lbs. I should be friggin' proud of my friggin' self. YES!! I am TALL (6 ft. to be precise), DARK (black hair, drab colored clothing, was said to have a dark looming presence *good* uhh.... grim demeanor and expressions so yes, dark literally and figuratively *thumbs up*) and HANDSOME? (Well... a teacher, a librarian, a cousin's wife who's been married for 20 years, certain looks given from women who are much older than me... yeah... essentially people who I have no prospect of dating due to obvious reasons... great or maybe the ones my age are afraid to tell me..*friggin' great* now I have no way of knowing since that's the one aspect of non-verbal communication I'm not very good at). STRONG (YES!! along with height, I tower above my older brother and almost everyone else in my family, contributing to aforementioned dark looming presence). SILENT (duh, known as the ""one who doesn't talk"" by a classmates mom, appeared to have come out of nowhere at times, apparently very sneaky too). *Alright* Now I slightly feel better about myself now.... I really want to go back into bed right now. I also need better endings to these streams of consciousness. They all end too abruptly."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Kelsay   I've found myself stalking this site for quite a while (not this forum, but the site itself), trying to get up the nerve to post something. I read the description of an ENFJ, and it kind of sounds too good to be true. Like, ""Damn, this person sounds awesome! That can't possibly be me."" Haha, is it common for ENFJ's to have low self-esteem? I have found that in my own home, and among my close friends, I'm ridiculously outgoing, loud, obnoxious. I can be blunt, selfish, insecure. But when meeting new people, or in a public setting, I'm much more reserved. I don't like to draw attention to myself in an unfamiliar setting, I prefer to sit back and observe until I feel comfortable. I don't like to call myself ""a giver""; I feel like a lot of the time, when people broadcast good things about themselves it's to cover up their own insecurities, such as, ""I hate drama"", ""I'm an open book"", ""I'm a great girlfriend"". I've found that, when you meet someone, if a statement like that is one of the first things they tell you about themselves, you'd better anticipate the opposite, if that makes any sense? But I guess there's a fine line between overwhelming insecurities and a healthy dose of confidence. However, that being said, I do know there isn't anything in this world I wouldn't do for the people I care about. Honestly, I'd still probably do almost anything for someone I don't give two-shits about, if they needed it. I read some things ENFJ's said about their personalities, like that everybody knows them, they have ""a cult following on facebook"", people quote them; none of this rings true for me. Some things I do know: I want everyone to love me, all the time. If you're having a rough night, I'll be up until 4am talking you through it, even if I have to be up at 6am. Growing up, I was frequently told to ""use your inside voice"". Losing friends makes my heart feel heavy, literally. My fulfillment comes from helping other people. I can be very selfish, and I hate to admit that. I HATE being alone, most of the time. I have a lot of energy, and am very patient. Am I alone on this?"
ISFP,"Originally Posted by ferroequinologist   I don't know how easy you would find this to do, but affirmation is a really big thing--letting him know that who he is, how he is, etc. is just fine. yeah, subtle words of appreciation for what he's done is fine, but he also needs to know he's OK, and you are OK with him, just as he is. That is the kind of affirmation he will appreciate. BTW, I've sort of made it a bit of a study to watch ISFPs when they perform, and specifically, how they act when they are done singing. They may acknowledge the applause, but it will be subtle, but they will not wallow and relish in it. They are more likely to do something like raise a hand, and then turn around and walk away. There's a video out there of Tom Petty and Bob Dylan singing Knockin' on Heaven's Door. Bob, at the end, simply turns around, puts on his scarf and walks off stage. This is very common--Michael Jackson, Dave Gilmour, and bunches more. They don't do it for the praise and adoration. That is noise to them, and uncomfortable. They do it to perform. an excited audience when they are performing is enough. When done, they turn off and leave. Compare them to other performers (like the Tom Petty video), or how Roger Waters acts after they are done performing (I have in mind the ""reunion"" when Dave played Comfortably Numb for Roger a few years ago). Your ISFP is not unique. He's quite normal and this is healthy behavior for an ISFP, nothing to be scared of or worried about... :-)    hmmm yeah for sure, I think I naturally am affirming to friends though too.  Even when I first met this friend, I let him know that his thoughts and all that he was, was awesome!  I don't exactly understand why someone would ever be good friends with another person if they didn't love or accept them the way they are.  I hope to learn and grow from others, and try and understand the way they see things etc.  At times it seemed like he didn't want to share his ideas, and thoughts, especially if it conflicted with someone else's view.  He did say once that he didn't think his thoughts were necessarily as important as someone else's. I understand keeping harmony, but I think everyone has something wonderful to bring, so I would always let him know that I wanted to know what he thought and valued his opinion.  I don't know if it did any good, but he was pretty open with me and closer friends for sure.  I am not sure if that's what you meant by affirmation.  But yeah it's definitely a great reminder to make sure our friends know we appreciate them for who they are - so thanks! :)  That's interesting about the performers too.  Are you saying that an ISFP may not take genuine appreciation and praise too well?  In saying all of this I definitely think it depends on the person too, because everyone is so different - he is especially very different than some other ISFP friends I have.  I suppose when talking about a meyer briggs personality I use it as a general tendency one type may have. Thanks!"

(sorry lol, that's what I really want to say.), but I know maybe he's just really not ok with burdening, to even extreme measures. This is gonna sound uh, idk, perhaps like a weird issue or something, it's hard to talk to him the way you say because I feel like I have to utilize some form of compassion and soft talk that feels uncomfortable like saying ""You know you can always call me it's no problem."" or something, and as normal as that sounds it sounds like something said in a movie and not how real people talk and it's just not gonna come out my mouth because of how weird it makes me feel. I do wish he would just know that we are family and I'm willing to pick him up purely off that fact that he's my cousin that's what I'm supposed to do, but maybe he doesn't and I should actually say something. I notice other's who aren't family have an easier time getting him to talk than myself. Only time we talk effortlessly is when we are on the topic of music."

ISFP,"I do believe that if you did nothing wrong and have not been pushy or arrogant, it's up to the other person to start the communication again, at the least. Of course, if you really have no idea, you should ask.

ESTP,"I just wanted to let you types know that you are adorable. This is based on experience with a lovely ESTP/ENTP girl, who is most likely ESTP.

She threw her head back laughing out loud when I told her about a few instances, where she was adorable (figured an example was the way to go with her)."
INTP,"There are other things at play, though. How much of the debt that we've incurred over the past few years is truly necessary? Politically, certain groups are more inclined to be ... more generous, shall we say, in order to appease the masses. Your standard citizen won't realize it, but inflation is pretty much a tax. Everyone is worth a little less, yet few realize it. Until they want to go buy things like food."

Then my sister and I hit the volleyball around a bit, and while we were sitting on the grass waiting for more players he came up.  After a bit of small talk lamenting the lack of players this year, he said, ""When's your last day?""  I said, ""Oh, actually Friday was my last day.""  He's like ""Oh, that sucks.  So I won't see you again until next year!  Maybe I could get your e-mail address or something so you can keep in touch and tell us how you're doing.""  I'm like ""Oh, well, I don't know where I will work after I graduate, but yeah, I just might come back.  Everyone seems to want me back.""  And then I saw a different guy who played volleyball last year and called out to him to ask if he wanted to play, to further move away from the topic of getting my e-mail address.  No I am not giving you any more personal information!!  Then I excused myself to get a drink and left him with my sister.  Apparently when I was gone, he said, ""Oh are you her sister?""  She's like, ""Yep.""  He's like, ""Oh.  So how old is she anyway?""  My sister just lied and said, ""She's 21.""  (Even though I'm 22.)  And he's like, ""Oh, I'm bad...  Just kidding.""

ENTP,I suppose in today's day and age that joke has lost its luster.
ESFJ,"(I also don't like picking out the background music because I don't know what type of music everyone likes... I totally overthink it. lol!

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Tainted Streetlight   When are you more active, Summer or Winter?    Definitely summer because when it's warm I feel more like working out, getting out of bed/the shower and more inclined to eat healthier etc. It's not that I necessarily like Summer better though, I really love Autumn and Spring."
ISTJ,5. Should I even start with trying to explain why clubbing isn't an ISTJ's cup of tea???
ENFP,Originally Posted by Storejerky   How often do you question reality?    Sometimes I'm just asking myself Is this real life? Or is this just fantasy?
ENFJ,"Begin friendships ""let's see where it goes"". With no expectation, don't expect the worst or the best.  "
ISFP,"I feel so cold, but I know I'm not. Or I feel that I am not. I can feel warm because I decide to be warm, not because I am. The ability to dictate my feelings almost overwhelms me, I control myself internally; but no matter what I do I can't polish the outside. And it sucks because it feels like I try so hard to be natural and real and passionate and genuine and caring: I feel all those things so intensely. But I'm not any of them. Ugh"
ENFP,i tend to get along with all Ts and NFp but fjs - though i respect them and find them caring - they drain out all my energy - especially esfj
ISFP,"I have several ISFP peoples in my life. One is my brother, another a friend or several (that I do not know of). I must ask what do you guys think of us INFPs? What kind of people do you flock towards and feel comfortable with? I am nuts and crazy myself and assertive so at times I wonder if I am being like overbearing or mean i some way or another, with any of my friends. I guess I mean maybe I can be or come as aggressive in things especially when it comes to the people I care for. Like one of my ISFP friends she has adhd so I told her its best to get some medication to help her focus. Just my opinion, and then the next week i see her she has adhd medication. O.o I was like.....uhhh thinking did I just do something wrong? I did not expect her to listen to me honestly. O.o Yeah this is me worrying and overthinking....Sigh."
ENTP,I have noticed today that I have 420 thanks received.

ENFP,And now I'm done catching up...yay! Time to find something else to do.
ISFJ,"How do your Ti and your Ne come into play in your everyday lives?    I found it funny, because its true"
ESTP,Notice how he didn't care to comment about Fi in the third position
ISTJ,"Not only do I have to do both of their jobs. Oh no! I also have to do MY FUCKING OWN!    If you would of asked me, I would have warned you not to work at the KMart in Kearney, Nebraska... Oh, wait, you're not? Well, all the same, you have my deepest sympathies."
INFJ,"You know, people constantly criticizing others for venting on fb only drives me further into my shell. My significant other tells me it shouldn't matter what others say; that I should post for myself, but really.. how can I feel safe enough to share myself and my life with family and friends who criticize those simply letting out how they feel? Who am I supposed to trust, and what do I use as an outlet if no one wants to hear it? And this goes beyond fb. It's the mere principal of feeling I need to keep quiet, when really, I shouldn't have to. I hate that I require this ""green light"" from others that lets me know it's safe to be me. Kind of pathetic."
INTP,A similar hypothesis goes like this... Intelligent life doesn't exist because they would have built Von Neumann machines (machines that are capable of self replication) that would have spread throughout the galaxy by now.

ENFP,"-K    Personally, I can't speak for everyone. but what I meant was, solving the mystery is just as exciting as knowing it straight up. for example, ENFP's like being the center of attention. I'm an attention whore, and can admit that while I am not proud of it. But at the same time, for our own security, we want to feel like we're trusted to the same degree. I would say that if something comes up, or if the ENFP is upset and you have a similar experience, show her/him how you understand. tell her how you felt, and she'll compare it. don't just dish your autobiography on the ENFP cause this will come across as a bit irritating. It's not so much about giving the information slowly as it is about timing. if it's something dark, don't bring down their mood. If they ask, tell. If they don't ask, but you want to tell, and the ENFP is in a more calmer less bubbly mood. not necessarily depressed, but more grounded I guess(..Yes...This can happen at times...) that would be a good time to ask like.. ""Can I tell you something?"" Or something along those lines. Just make sure the ENFP isn't PMS'ing- that will be scary... JUST A WARNING. And ENFP's ARE impatient. don't keep the secret too long, and try to help them figure it out. Let them learn it, and once an ENFP or myself at least finds that she's truly interested, she will straight up ask what she thinks she found out. as far as subtleties go, ENFP's over analyze everything, so before you leave a subtly, analyze it yourself in every possible way it could be taken. If the majority is decent, then it's probably good start. Oh, and ENFP's prefer to be the clingy ones. clingy+clingy=no good. So don't be over attached, but don't be withdrawn. Make sure the ENFP KNOWS how you feel, and is not guessing on matters like that. but don't just shower her with constant attention. and try to seem brave. insecurity comes off to an ENFP as neediness, and can be annoying. even your body language can seem annoying. at least to me. Make sure she knows your feelings, but don't make her feel like the game is over. cause that's how I at least see it, a game. and I prefer games like temple run, because they never end."

INFP,"Even more amazing is the fact that when psychopaths do get exposed by someone who is not afraid to admit that they have been conned, the psychopath is a master at painting their victims as the ""real culprits."" Hare cites a case of the third wife of a forty year old high school teacher:"
ISTJ,"(The latter really is technically a crime; it's a misdemeanor, although I can't remember if it's a Class B or C off the top of my head.  The battery would be a Class A misdemeanor, if he was in fact arrested, he'd probably be ROR'd the next day, but he'd spend the night in jail.)    We could all benefit from a ""summon Sela"" spell. Just say her name three times or something and the doors burst open and in she comes, in full roller gear and hits the offending ass at full steam."
ISTP,"Watch this video, he had perfect pitch and he could actually tune his guitar while playing it! Look for when he makes adjustments while playing."
INTJ,"(I have a friend who I believe is an INTJ. He has changed a lot over the last year, since he came to the conclusion aforementioned. I think he relied very heavily on Te, but now he sees it as obsolete in many regards. He now claims to be much more of a feeler. I don't think his type changed. I am wondering if he turned to Fi, and strengthened the function, to make up for his lack of interest in objective reasoning...?) "

I mean, I'm not nearly as emotional as some of my ENFP friends, and I take interest in science and philosophy more than pony stuff. But I feel 100% related to ENFPs, does that make me an ENFP? :P    I'm the same. I feel...un-ENFP-ish at times. I don't believe in stuff like soul mates, or my horoscope. It seems like a big pile of BS to me, science all da way. In regards to the emotional aspect...I don't feel I cry as much as I should for an ENFP o_o. I've been described as a ""harsh bastard""...the only thing that will have me in tears in seconds is animal abuse. When the commercials come on for it my face is like Niagara Falls. OH and old people abuse, and seeing an old man/woman eating alone in a restaurant. I just feel the urge to get emotional as hell about that. Anything else I don't...really care. So yeah...guess we can still be a member of the ENFP club :)."
INTJ,"He has not abandoned thinking, but I think he relies on it muuuuch less now. "
ENFJ,"Add to that another cyclist almost collided with me and then watched me fall forward onto the crossbar while trying to avoid him and not so much as a ""are you alright?""  I'm black and blue in places now and angry about that failure to be a gentleman on his part."
ESTP,"What does he really want from me?    I don't know him, so I can't say with any surety. We tend to bond over activities. Do you have something that you and your father both and enjoy doing together? Or can you find something that you and your father both enjoy doing? Is there any common ground? "
ISFJ,"You can talk about how you will be there, supportive in every way that you can, and that you will be the factor of reliability, goodness, love, and support no matter what. This is very reassuring to ISFJ when the mind is thinking of worst case outcomes, because it pulls the mind back to certainties and trusting in what WON'T change."

As much as I want to directly question her, I don't want to make things worse by demanding her to deal with something she's not ready to deal with and have her ending up resenting me.=/"
ESTP,Originally Posted by laikta   I think we use our external sensors (observing facial expression and body language) and some thinking (analysing) to read people rather than using the feeling.. since feeling is not so developed within us. Hehe but they kind of do the same job in a way.    It's like I can detect what people are thinking without talking to them. This has gotten me into trouble with the Feeling crowd.
ENTP,It almost sounds related to control issues. Are you gerally dissappointed when people don't act (expect things) in a way you do?    I was just trying to be polite :)

I believe someone pointed out it seemed very Ni. Anyone remember the name of the article or know where I can find it or any specific verbiage so I can search for it myself? Thanks."

ENFJ,"I guess it just amused me that someone who I had left behind so far in the past still had that effect on those people, that the mere reminder of me caused their behaviour and attitude to recede straight back into what it was aged 16: I've largely moved on from who I was, they haven't. And you know what? The people who sit on the top of the food chain acting like jerks leave school underprepared. Nobody has stood there and alienated them, their flaws haven't been pointed out on a daily basis and, above all, they have never been judged for the virtue of being different. They have absolutely no concept of the way the world really works, how in order to survive it you need to always be prepared, always ready to adapt. They can't change because they still have no awareness of the impact of their actions had on others; in their heads, they won't ever move past the days when they were 16 and the world seemed to turn just for them."
ISFP,"I was really discouraged at first cause I was like WHO AM I?! after taking the test. I related most to ISFP but mistyped as INFP and ISFJ. I think under stress I relate to them. I am in no way naturally ISFJ, but having two kids makes me feel that way. Like I force myself into that role. I can see ISFJ's being invaluable individuals - I admire them. I was sad to see so much negativity about them in the forums. Took it a little personally when I mistyped as ISFJ. So <3 for the ISFJ's. And then INFP's - they have this different type of intelligence (not to say ISFP's aren't intelligent, I'm speaking for myself here - I tend to only be knowledgable in areas that really grab me and that information I can retain) and they seem to be more comfortable in their cozy little bubbles, whereas I get super antsy after too long of just being...I have to do/plan on doing or even just voice I'm going to do something to better my life. I have a hard time just being content. Always jumping out my skin but never knowing where to focus or go with that feeling. Except outdoors. My challenge is to relax, I've gotten better about taking care of myself, but I naturally have to be doing/improving to feel good about life...or I have to be in a state of thankfulness due to seeing a good result of my actions (usually in relation to my kid's accomplishments or like making food for a friend and they enjoy it, etc) to truly relax. If that makes sense. INFP's seem more accepting of themselves, but maybe I'm wrong. Just my observations. I am not very knowledgable on the functions. But it's all interesting. Hope to learn more."
INFP,"I can see that I really can be an extrovert, especially to do what I need to get done. Group-wise, I""m fine with one person or working alone. In fact, I'm capable of working a whole shift alone, and perform better without having to check in with a coworker. In addition to that, I am able to initiate positive change. But through and through, I need my alone time. Just because I learned to be more expressive and professional doesn't change that one bit. That's why I'm Fi dominant, and not Ne dominant. That's why I'm an INFP. Not because a test said so, but because my life, experiences, and my self are on the same page with it."

I even feel awkward at times speaking to my therapist about how stone cold I must appear to people who don't know me very well, and how I was raised to suppress my emotions.

So any advice to help him build a better relationship with his girlfriend's little sister would also be appreciated.    What do you mean by ""getting through"" to her?

But right now, it sounds more like you have a problem with her entire being, having judged her and her behaviour pretty negatively in several aspects (I see nothing positive mentioned here), so based on that, I'd say don't be so idealistic as to think you can change someone so completely to conform to your standards, well, if you have such standards.

The first dream I had was actually during an afternoon nap where I saw myself 'free running' and doing a lot of parkour related stuff which turned violent as a mob chased me around empty corridors with the intention of murder. It was a light-hearted dream but it left a bad taste in my mouth. My adventurous dreams usually don't turn violent :/

And are just sitting around nearby talking about dumb emotions and stuff... When we should be driving to the other side of the country. It just kills me. I hate waking up stressed out. My job at the antique store and my old dance troupe both fit in here somewhere too, it was really stressful. And a bunch of homeschool mom's were there, which is annoying. The best (?)part of the dream is that although I tries to atop the guy several times l, he never got me for some unlikely reason. The actual best part was when a little boy have me a hug. That was probably one of the sweetest moments I have ever dreamed.Eventually the guy ran out of bullets, so then he was pushing people off the building. And I didn't realize it at the time, but that was actually me doing that, in a sense. At that point of the dream I was suddenly seeing it all from his point of view, even more terrifying. O_OJust scary. He was like a personality cross between the Joker and the Jackal, but just a skinny, pale, gaunt old man.    I had a dream recently that someone rounded up everyone at my school and brought us to an underground facility to be euthanized...kinda like the Nazis. It was really stressful and freaky.

When the average citizen has to spend his entire working life to pay mortgage for his flat (because the cost of an average flat costs approx 143 times of an average citizen's monthly salary). How is this fair? Isn't it the government's job to put in their best effort to close this income gap? Instead, they are getting paid so much more than most other leaders in the world (Minister gets paid S$1.1 million annum as entry salary & PM gets 2.2 mill after pay cut excluding bonus and life long pension!).

INTP,"Speaking of which, it is so banal to go through these years amongst the people who just don't understand the deeper desire for learning and true knowledge. While I appreciate the constant good feelings of friends I cannot go without saying that I most enjoy just getting teachers to ramble on about obscure ideas and thoughts and theories, losing about half of my class, but the truly intellectual ones I can easily pick out by their genuine interest. This has caused me to be an inhibitor to most routine discussion but a promoter of deeper, more interesting paths of education and coming to a consensus of understanding with these fellow students through the process of a Socratic teaching method."
ISFP,"Ah yes there it is, that old spark that lust for a real life that I felt at the beginning of the year. Sometimes I just need to kick myself up the arse to get going again."
INFP,"I don't think people realize what they're doing when they criticize me. It's not just merely painful. I'm more than well aware that I'm a flawed creature. In fact, there were times when I thought I had too many problems to be worth the air I breathe. I trained myself not to focus on those things and instead think of what great things I could do in this world if I continued my existence. Still, I cannot help but acknowledge my shortcomings automatically. People, when you highlight my inadequacies, you are just compounding my great shame. Honestly, every time, I consider ending myself. I wish you would just learn to focus on other things, as I do, and I try to do for others as well, so we could avoid that dark place together."
ENFJ,I hope that helps a bit?  Just know there are mothers who can sympathize with you.

ENFJ,"I hate doing Maths homework with my INFP son.  He doesn't listen, then he starts making smartass remarks, then I lose my temper and my whole day is ruined by this individual.  He is so bloody stubborn that half the time he won't allow you to explain things to him because he thinks he knows it all.  I actually am at the end my tether and don't know how the hell to motivate him."
INFP,Why can't I fly.  Surely then I could find somewhere where I fit in
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by CorgiGirl   A large problem is that I'm not currently in the same city she's in. I'm in my hometown right now. And I'm not living with her next year. I may fb chat her asking innocently for an explanation, saying that I didn't quite understand it or something. Then she won't get defensive. I do not know why, I account it to INFJ/ISTJ conflict, but for some reason she's intimidated by me. So she may not want to BS herself in a way that I'll notice.    There's very little room for allowing communication differences to get in the way. You'll just have to be direct and up front in asking her why the bill suddenly rose. Ask whoever is also living there to get a copy of the bill. Sorry, but $30 extra with no explanation is sketchy and should have raised a red flag. I'm not ready to jump to conclusions yet, but secrecy accompanies lying. If she has a legitimate reason, she'll tell you and produce records."
ENFJ,I am moving each day ... I really am .. progress .. but I have no way of objectively measuring my progress ... and revealing it to others. I don't want to even exist sometimes but I do. I don't want to want anymore but that's impossible.
ISFJ,"-you try to smile and have eye contacts with the people you know so that they won't feel bad but when they're the ones that is ignoring you, you feel a little paranoid and uncomfortable."

INTJ,----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ENFJ,"Ugh. Well, mom, even though I don't feel comfortable telling you yet (but deep inside I really want to tell you), I am at least in a relationship that will hopefully yield grandchildren in the future. But it's going to take some damn time to be in a financial and emotional state that is conducive to having children, so chill out on the pressure about having them. All in good time :)    ha ugggh don't you just hate it when people pressure you to make stupid decisions when they know nothing about it."
ENFP,And this would be due to the fact that you don't get much of a feedback - being the other one the introvert of the introverts and really private person - or because of the moral conduct of office rules ?
ESTP,And yes I have two teenagers who he hasn't met because I haven't seen him in months. I am not planning to marry him without those interactions. I simply want the interactions to continue or for this to end. I don't like gray. 
INFJ,update: ... apparently blue tissues means I need a new box of tissues. 
ISFP,"Originally Posted by The red spirit   You, that eyes are enough to paint human, I asked, I haven't got answer. I think, that this is clickbait (well not really, but bait of some other type).

I don't draw people I am not connected to in some way, unless you were asking me to do commission work."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Zen Lizard    I'm absorbed in my own thoughts much of the time or fairly focused on conversations with friends, and I can miss some pretty obvious stuff as a result.    haha :) you can say that again!!"
ESFP,I stayed in contact with my ex well now boyfriend (we have decided to make things work and both agreed will wait for each other). We both did not move on. If I did move on I would need closure after a breakup with someone I loved. Otherwise it would impact on my well-being and give me a sense of false hope.
INFJ,"Told Sam I was going to do things the way I do things, I did not give a fat fuck what administration thinks.  "
INFP,"I'm starting to believe that I just like  hurting myself. Not physically but emotionally. I was feeling absolutely fine today and I told myself that I wasn't going to do something for awhile because it would just make me sad. And then I did it anyway and now I'm sad. At first I just thought I would be able to handle it since I felt good, but I just ended up feeling bad afterwards like always. I think it's because I've always been told no pain no gain so I hurt myself to be a stronger person, but it doesn't work well. And I  need to stop feeling sorry for myself everytime."
ENTP,Would you be willing to argue in favor of animal cruelty? 
INTJ,"Then click on the ""intuition"" link.     ok, the rest of that context helped me a lot, thanks :)"
INTP,"I wonder what I should make on G-Mod! Just downloaded it today after playing it on my friends laptop. It had better run or Acer will be car bombed. Seriously, keep your eyes on the news. If you hear the name ""Zach"" mentioned, you know its me. So back to the G-Mod thing... what do you guys think I should make?"
ENFJ,My life sucks right now because of nobody but myself.
ESTP,"Redux version : A man wants to marry me a couple of months in the relationship, but hasn't showed consistency for a while nor can I consider myself trusted by him. Which begs the question : how do you even build something as an unit if you can't feel trusted ?"
INTP,Story: I was trying to jump across a mud puddle because I'd been trying to run across the street because this car was going faster than I'd thought he'd been because he's an asshole or something.

ESFJ,"My cousin in another state just got married this weekend, and her brother, an ESFJ, who I haven't seen in a few years, messaged me and said he missed seeing me there! We're sort of distant cousins and we haven't had much contact over the years but we're all the same age and have tons in common and I fit in with their family more than any other family I'm related to, and he's always gone out of his way to make and maintain a connection with me as if I were their long-lost sibling. I love this guy."
ISFP,My older sister was watching 'Once Upon A Time' on netflix. There was this dramatic scene involving two characters. One of them had an eye on each palm instead of their face. The character raises her hands to view everything.

ESFP,Originally Posted by XiuZi   Any type can be compatible. It's really up to the individual.    I concur. Some just have to compromise more in the relationship than others.
ESTP,"Hello, guys! I did a test for one of my characters in a story I'm writing. He seems to be an ESTP. I'm far from an ESTP myself, so I have some questions."
ISFJ,"Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk    I was typed as INFP. The process began when someone said that I used Fe. I said ""I'm not an INTP. I originally thought I was but I realized I valued feeling over thinking."" But he said he thought I was ISFJ. It turns out I didn't understand what being a sensor was because of the stereotypes. I'm smart and spacy and creative, of course I thought I was Ne aux. then I learned Si can be smart and spacy and creative too. I just had to look deeper into it. "
INFJ,"Hmmm....with everything we've learned about 'what gives you energy' for introverts vs. extraverts and what it means to know yourself; this really gets my mind spinning.  I love the message of keeping a soft and open heart.  I believe love really thrives and grows in that sort of 'soil.'   But does this author intend to imply that by being depleted  by when 'present' sometimes, that it is just a matter of having a closed heart in that moment?   How can I reconcile my beliefs of trying to be a loving person and following God's example, with loving myself and allowing time for introversion without it meaning 'closing my heart'?  This is another example of where I want things to be black and white, but where 'both are true' is probably more accurate."
ENTP,If you only have 3 days to live (now your Ne would be useless and there'd be no possibilities anymore) what would you do and why?

ESFP,"Originally Posted by drummaster350   First off I want to say that I love ESFPs.  They know to show love and how to receive love.  Their childlike wonder is very attractive,occasionally aggravating, but mostly cute.  My question is this: how come you lovely ladies cannot take even the most carefully worded, objective, loving, constructive criticism?  I've calmly tried to explain to my ESFP lady friend how I felt about some of the things that she was doing that were harmful to me, our work crew, and herself.  It was like I'd stabbed her, she looked so wounded, which was then followed by unspoken anger.  I could tell she was upset with herself, upset with me, and I felt terrible but she knows that I love her.  I wouldn't have taken the time to confront her if I didn't care.  Could you ESFP's please explain why you take criticism so personally?  (By the way you guys look really cute when you're angry .)    Objective criticism is worse! I am not great with criticism, but I wouldn't normally get angry about it...just wounded."
ISTP,Hope that in time she calls me to talk too. That would be great.
ESTP,"When you want to do something, oh boy you want it.

Antibiotics don't treat viral infections, but they prevent secondary bacterial infections from arising when a person has the flu. The immune system becomes overwhelmed by the influenza virus and your mucosal membranes become inflamed, making it easy for bacteria to attack your respiratory tract. So many physicians give antibiotics to prevent these conditions."
ESTP,Put them in their place and such things usually stop; giving you the respect you deserve.
INTP,I wonder how that faired off for them or if it was a one time hype project thing.

INFP,Why is it when you bust out of your shell or say something a little 'forward' your mind starts lashing the fuck out of you and some feelings manifest in weird and strange ways. 
ESTP,There is this ESTP man that i found very interesting. I love his ability to get along with many ppl and switching between charming and cheesy in a blink. And so far I am able to repress my dreaminess about exploring new theories.

ISFP,"@The red spirit  Don't have to comment on Socionics type if you don't, I barely understand it myself XD As for INFP I suppose I'm good with it? I just want to make sure I'm typed correctly for my own satisfaction :) I like to introspect, I like to explore my own mind and make sure I'm living up to my best potential. That is what I want to use systems like MBTI for. Just understanding more about the kind of person I am and how I can live best, making the best choices which take advantage of my natural strengths. That's all. It's not like I'm invested in being any one particular type and if I'm not that type it'll make me unhappy. I'm good regardless."

He has been a major positive influence on my professional life."
ENFP,"Ah well. ENFP friends will have to remain a delicious pipe dream. Rumour has it they get on well with INTJs, and I'd love to find someone who drops off the face of the planet LESS often than I do, so they would organise us to do things and chase me up...and yet have things in common to discuss... Ah well."
ENTJ,"IOW, what subject are you keen to talk about but rarely get to, for one reason or another.    I like it when people want to talk about off-the-wall topics.

That's how my head works.   Feed me.) "
ESFP,"In short, do you think you have become more prejudiced or more tolerant?Sorry for the grammatical errors..    Love the thought provoking questions! Here`s my opinion:"
ISTJ,"I am pretty fucking pissed off right now. I just discovered something here on PerC that represents a staggering hypocrisy. I personally witnessed something happen recently that I probably should have intervened in, something that felt inappropriate at the time, and now I see something parallel to that has happened, and those involved in the earlier event that I stood by and watched have taken the opposite position. The hypocrisy, and my own failure to intervene in the earlier event, have my adrenaline cranking. I feel an inner conflict between my drive to expose this bullshit and my desire for peace, considering how many more problems I would cause than solve. I have a birthday party I organized for my six year old in thirty minutes, and I somehow need to get my shit under control before this thing starts."

I can't even pretend I know what's going on in there, nor do I really care; but I do care about discipline, and the kid needs to learn respect as she enters her tween years)? Either that, or if you can make some suggestions as to how I could put the fear of God into her via her video game of choice, feel free to message me."

ESFJ,"Last September I saw my ESFJ friend at a large gathering. He got telling me something about something or other and to illustrate his point he started to say ""you remember at the festival this summer . . ."", paused, and he (not I) said ""oh, you weren't at the festival, you were at home in the US"". I was really impressed, because everybody who's anybody in our circle was at that festival, and most men I know who regularly encounter as many people as he does (I mean by the dozens and hundreds) do not remember who was what or where. He also remembered my name from the first time I met him and when introducing a small group of us to some other people at a later time he didn't even hesitate to recall my name. This guy remembers the personal details."
INFJ,All I did was take what everyone else was suggesting and turn it into a grammatically correct sentence.
INFP,"Geez, sometimes I'm glad I am not a girl because I would be extremely awkward in a position like that. Actually, lowercase extremely isn't cutting it: EXTREMELY AWKWARD. On one hand, I'd like to get hit on for self-reassurance, but on the other hand most of the ones doing the deed are not ones you want to be getting hit on by."

He kind of reminds me of an ENFP. I can see people confusing him with an ESFP but really he was never a party type of guy and once he feel in love that was it, he was SUPER loyal.

INTJ,"The weeks before election there are political meetings around the country with panels consisting of representatives from the different parties. What is less known is that similar model panels are arranged in some of the elementary schools around the country where the schools send out invitations to the different political parties and their youth organizations. I went to many of these representing my party and felt less nervous than if it had been the ""real"" thing. I didn't do well the first times but at least it didn't cost votes. Another good thing about these model elections was that often the pupils voted both before and after the panel hearing so I'd get a feedback on how well/how poorly I'd done. This all prepared me for the real thing with more knowledgeable adults."
ISFJ,"I know what I said earlier about compliments kind of contradicts this but...I do think that an ISFJ would be more likely to just accept a compliment than analyze it.  I know that sounds stupid because I just did a whole ton of analysis...but I think that has a lot to do with the fact that you brought it up.  I think had you not asked the question, I wouldn't have been nearly as likely to sit down and think about the motives of the complimenting person.  In fact, by you asking the question, maybe you showed a little bit more of the T side of you, and you brought out the T side in me.  "
INTP,Hmm..that too. But I meant more like the education itself than the actual event of graduation.
INFP,"Originally Posted by periculosa   Emotions definitely hinder me also.  I did manage to successfully ignore them for perhaps ten years...then emotion came knocking, and knocked down the whole false house I built for myself.  I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse to discover I am INFP."
INTP,I'm pretty sure that reading through the Dark Tower series for the second time is going to be better than the first time.

ISFP,"I'd take a high-stakes, sometimes arrogant, domineering, informed leader who at least weighs your voice in the balance (even if ungently), goes with the flow (largely because he is making the flow), usually does what makes sense or laughs it off if he doesn't, and accepts or addresses your input, over any of the other ones any day, for an activity or project or even just chilling out. Is he rougher than I would be with people at times? Yes. Am I dishonest/hidden/capricious with people sometimes to a point where even he notices and dislikes it? Yes. Do we do similar things very differently sometimes? Yes. Do we have a very clear picture of each other's weakness and strength, so clear as to demand mutual respect? Very.

ISTP,"While you all are on the topic of feminism, I fell like in someways it did as much damage as it did god--and we're especially seeing it now among men and women of my generation, the children of the people who pioneered the movement. I see it especially in relationships: men who are too passive for fear of causing offense; men and women who are confused about what their role is supposed to be in society as a whole. Even among women my age I feel like a lot of them call themselves ""feminists"" without really understanding what it means, or even what it means to them (I saw this a lot at the women's college I went to--the women I went to school with paid a lot of lip service to this ideal--and that's exactly what feminism is, an ideal). So it gets watered down. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the things that the feminists did for women, but I think that rather than minimize the differences between men and women, they've increased them in some ways instead."

ISFP,"Originally Posted by lunaticrabbits   I've been noticing myself having particularly strong Si lately. No, it's not in the form of tradition or routines or the traditional way of thinking (I'm not sure if that's what Si really means, but...). I've just realized that I can go on doing the same stuff pretty much every day without getting really bored with my life. I do follow a routine, but it's not based on societal standards. It's based on my own interests and what I like to be doing in my everyday life. I have a lack of need to try new things or watch new shows too, and I tend to be satisfied with exploring different things within the same areas of interest. I can be also a little hesitant of change, but only in the long-term. Otherwise I can be pretty flexible and scatterbrained when it comes to dealing with everyday stuff. (I've read that in Socionics, ISFPs are supposed to have Si on the same strength level as our Fi. I also wondered if having strong unconscious Si might contribute to the 'mysteriousness' of ISFPs and ISTPs, on some level...)    I have that too. Once with ferre and one ISFJ we figured out, that Fi can look like Si, if it's paired with Se."

ISFJ,"Sometimes it can feel plain illogical, and that's even more frustrating because you can't even explain to the person why they're wrong    I can definitely see that as a legitimate problem, lol.

I've seen the traits you're talking about a bit more often in my mom (INFP) and my brother (ISFP), and yeah, it kind of wears my patience too sometimes. I think Fi can often incorrectly interpret Fe as conformity or ""hivemind"" and is in danger of self-erasure. I can tell you, badly-used Fe irritates the hell out of me, because it accuses me of being wrong on the basis of either ""majority rules"" or ""you're ruining other people's lives"", attempts to publicly shame me (lol, doesn't work; I'm sure my bemused expression doesn't help matters on their end), and *assumes* that I'm not using any logic in my approach to something. Not only that, I think that's more or less what Fi, if not balanced well by other functions, generally tends to see in Fe, even if it's used well and with good intentions.    "

I just finished a degree in Physics, but I got bored with that about 1/3 of the way through and now I want to move on to something else.  Also at the moment I play the piano, spend a lot of time researching various psychology and philosophy topics, and read books on almost everything.  My interests can last anywhere from a week to a couple of years, and I do sometimes go back to them, but at some point I invariably get bored and move on.

ISFJ,"But all in all I think INTPs and ISFJs make good friends.    It's odd how that works isn't it? My ISFJ friend and I have been friends for 12 or 13 years. We have gotten irritated with each other, but never seriously fought. Her ability to mess something up repeatatively JUST to spite me is irking. Her ability to make me laugh about it a second later, more so. They're just that friend meant to be."

He later phoned my husband and apologised for letting it out.  I don't know if they have always felt this way but I have always bent over backwards to fit in with my husband's family and it hasn't been easy at times.  The worst part is I am wondering how much of the last 16 years have been genuine if any of it.  Part of me would like to hurt her back by spilling a secret I know about her husband, but that is counter-productive and I know it would be wrong.  FYI, every time her husband drinks and we are present at a party or bar with them, he comes onto me, and I mean fully comes onto me, telling me that he would love to sleep with me, then when I laugh and say he doesn't mean that, he reiterates that he would.  I have rebuffed him so many times it is not funny, and got really angry at him 4 years ago at a party at our house.  Since then he appears to have gotten the message and left me alone.  I have never said anything to my sister in law because I didn't want to hurt her.  I have heard that he has had one affair, though I can not be 100% sure of the truth of that.   In fact I wonder if she is aware of how he feels about me and that is why she doesn't like me.  ??"

ESTP,Originally Posted by Selinda   I would like to know if other ESTPs feel a little controlled by J types.  I need to get a perspective.  Thanks    Any J types (e.g. ESTJ and INFJ alike)? What kind of controlling attitude are you experiencing with them (that I suppose is making you wonder about this)?
ENTJ,Compare him to Malcolm X. Malcolm is going for the throat. He is obviously agitated. A trait of Malcolm's. That finger. Always to his eye. I actually think Malcolm and Obama are the same type. Both great debaters with sharp minds. Similar mannerisms. Lanky and tall. I know it could sound racist but they look a lot alike. Malcolm could have been Obama if his family wasn't destroyed. The world made him hard I believe. Obama never hardened. Malcolm came from a perspective of rage.  
ESFJ,"But from my type evaluation elsewhere I appeared to match up quite well with the ESFJ profile, it just seems kinda funky given my lifestyle."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Cassieopeia   I have often empathized with the ""bad guys"" in situations... like my mom's boyfriend. He's an alcoholic and has verbally (all the time) and physically abused her. When that happened, I hated him, and when I think about it, I hate him, but when I see him and he's acting normal, I act nice and polite because I see a human being with feelings. He disgusts me, but at the same time, I feel compassion for him. ISFJ thing..? Lol    I do recognize that yes, although i haven't been in a situation like you. It's true that normally i am the one who also tries to see the point of view from the bad guy, even though he has done something reallyreally bad. Not all people understand though, some can even become angry when I defend someone who had done something really really bad. I have a lot of discussions with a friend who is ENTJ and she can become really angry when I try to defend someone who is on the news and has done something like murdered somebody."
ESFJ,"So in the past year I have went through a huge deal of things that kind of shook me. Ever since then I haven't been the same; critical, judge-y, too OCD for my taste. I dwell on all the small details and can't seem to get over them. One of the things that has been bothering me is I always stress out whenever I go out with my husband. I need to make sure we go to somewhere new on our date night and look for new places every week. If it doesn't go according to plan everything suddenly gets ruined. I even keep on nagging on him to find somewhere new and romantic, but instantly assume that he has absolutely no taste and whatever he'll come up with is going to be terrible. I always feel like I'm missing out on something; the same thing happens when we travel together. I cant seem to relax and have fun. I then compare myself with other couples and end up blaming him for us being boring. Is is weird that I don't even know how to enjoy spending time with husband?"

The last time I've visited forum, which was a couple of weeks ago, my actions were improper and incongruous which I apologize for, because I endlessly love each member of the ENFJ section. I resumed visits to the psychologist who came to conclusion that I possibly have a bipolar disorder - recently I was put on medications and have been doing much better since. I've never wanted to be bipolar, but I've always suspected having a disorder, as a logical explanation of the mood swings and odd behaviour. Currently I am learning to take control of myself and trying to find a balance. Hopefully I'll succeed at becoming a better version of myself.    Wow, hats off for the honesty. I'm sorry that you are going through what you are. However, I'm inspired by the fact that you are brave enough to face this challenge, and I'm confident that you will overcome it."

Fuck everyone. You're all sick and evil for making a world where needing something is enough to keep someone from having those needs fulfilled.  I hate this world.  I hate this life.  I want out, but I'm too unmotivated and cowardly to do anything about it.  I don't know who committed suicide the other day, if anyone actually did.  It wasn't me, because I'm afraid of dying, just like i'm afraid of everything else.  I'm afraid of living, too, but it's easier to passively stagnate than to actively change it.  I say it's because I like to keep my options open, but I'm seriously considering using those options to take ridiculous risks that will probably get me hurt, just to feel anything different from how I am feeling now.

You're pretty much right with the reflect and consider what happened and think about what I'm going to do next bit. If I'm in a situation where I'm probably going to talk to more than one person, alone time for me needs to happen between conversations. For example, when I'm at a party and I talk to someone, I usually just zone out and collect myself for a bit afterwards before trying to approach another person for conversation. Otherwise, I won't have enough energy to keep talking and absorbing information at a constant level for the whole night and can seem either pissed off or nervous. However, when I'm with a smaller group of people who I'm comfortable around and whose reactions I can kind of predict, I usually get a lot of ""keep your voice down""s and ""please stop doing that thing that's making us really conspicuous"".

To dream that  you are sailing the high seas in a ship denotes that you are still  standing tall despite the emotional turmoil occurring in your life.   To dream that a ship has crashed or sunk suggests that you are feeling  emotionally out of control. You are expressing some fear or uncertainly  within your emotional state.

ESTJ,3. Be inconsistent or brush me off are the more minor ones. They're the ones that will make me think you are an idiot and nullify any opinion beyond 'neutral' I had of a person.

INFP,Originally Posted by Cinnamon   I just looked up 'rape' on the internet. And found a forum full of people with rape fantasies. I don't have the words to express how angering that is. My head is just a boil. People are so fucking ugly.    That's sick.

ENFJ,"For once, I'm really annoyed at some ENFJs. Not anyone here, in another group. They started talking about sensors as a group and said things like ""they don't want to try anything new"", ""they are so resistant to change"", ""they don't interest me at all"". "

ENFP,"@The King Of Dreams  said. Sometimes I don't even notice and my friends must remind me to go back to the previous subject. If I could control I would, but with Ne is hard to do it."

ISFP,"What it means is that either you are not tuned into her Se world, to notice that she's talking without words, or she hasn't yet opened up to you enough to talk. What _that_ means is that you haven't yet deserved it. Why that is, is up to her. But if you've pushed too much, or just don't fit within her wavelength (think resonance--if you don't operate at a compatible frequency--way of thinking/observing--she just hasn't taken you on board. What it all means is that you are not as close as you may think. Of course, this could be because of point number 1 above."

ISTJ,"But as to people at work problems, ugh, that's why I'm a recluse.  People are idiots, rude, obnoxious, etc., etc."
ISTP,Originally Posted by cursive   My INFP and flyincaveman tipped me over to view it. INFP was on my ass for weeks to watch it.    Glad to know my opinion has that much sway with you.
ISFP,"I need to desperately sort out money, it's the only part of my life thats getting me down."
ENFJ,"I think that I'm not totally sure that I know what love is, or, rather, can differentiate between different kinds of love very well. (Like, loving your parents, versus loving your friends, versus loving your lover / are you really in love, or are you just attached, etc?) I think some of my negative experiences have made it hard for me to really acknowledge, let alone express my love for others, and it's something that bugs me. Is this a problem others have?"
ISFJ,"I mean, ideally, the other person involved would need to start the conversation to give me the chance to explain my side"
INTJ,"Originally Posted by BloodRedWidow   How do you guys deal with nerves? I try and focus on the task at hand, but sometimes it doesn't work.

Now I perform quite a bit of public speaking and play music in front of people. So this is not going to come off well, but here it goes:"
ESTP,"I live in Canada and at least 50% of the population are NFs. Very idealistic and nice, to be general about it. But i think most of them are Feeling types overall, even the T/F divide in men doesn't seem that wide. I do believe that the majority are introverts around here, because of the sparsity of the population in smaller cities and because public transit is SO quiet and most people are extremely exclusive by only speaking with their friends and not accepting new acquaintances into their tightly-knit circle of faith.

ENTP,"OK, ENTPs, here is the question I've been pondering this morning. If Thou Shalt Not Kill is the first commandment, how did the Crusaders justify killing in the name of God?"
ISTJ,Me:  Thank you for stopping by.  I need to get back to work now.

INTP,"Random Thought #2 -- I've been researching Creatine products and have started doing a lot of home exercises with pull-ups, chin-ups, squats, lunges, and so on. I need more information about the conversion of ADP to ATP and the replenishment of phosphates. Working out at a gym seems too expensive and too distracting. I think this routine will work well for now (I have started two weeks ago, and have noticed an increase in lift and repetition)."

ISTP,Originally Posted by cursive   Memes are heaven-sent.
ESFP,But some ESFPs can appear to be drunk when they are sober. I guess that makes them cool.    that's how we 'activate' among other people. we ARE extroverts after all
ISFP,"Oh, about INFJs dancing around the truth, I wouldn't know about that because I only know one INFJ and that's my best friend. She tells me how she feels (10 years of friendship!) about things when I ask and even goes on rants.       Originally Posted by merryberry   Oh yes, of course. I would never put all of these people in one box, but I do think some major driving forces involved could be feelings of lacking purpose in life, greed, lust, pride, and having been deceived by someone/something. What are your thoughts?    Oh, sorry for not being clear about my question! I meant that if you came across reading about a certain murderer or a group of terrorists in the papers, for example, do you think about their major driving forces? Not just putting all of them into one box, of course; we humans are more complicated than that. :) But to answer your question, I do agree with the major driving forces you mentioned although sometimes I also think it could be their beliefs. When you believe in something, and you believe it to be true, it IS true even though the entire world is telling you that you're wrong (in murdering/starting a war in the name of religion, etc). Also, if it's the environment they grew up in, if they always saw their cousins/parents robbing a bank/cheating people etc, then that's all they know."
INTP,"They should have to think about how it would feel to have someone you know, like, and depend upon blown to pieces while you watch before being able to decide whether that will happen to someone else. "
INTP,I found that realization at once frustrating and kind of liberating.  It was never about me to begin with.
INTJ,My question is this.  How do you reach a stage where you are feeling empathy/compassion?  Is it from experience or is it trying to view yourself from their perspective or perhaps some other means? 
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by nosilla    Everyone that I personally know that wants a summer job already has a job for the summer, because they work during the semester too.    Oh yeah....we have a program called co-op in University. We work during one of the semesters. This is an easy way to get a job too. For you, I guess try volunteering in another hospital then. "

INTP,"It's 1:34am, and I probably shouldn't be up. I really like the right-ness of the time right now, though. Its numbers are all Fibonacci-esque, except they start on strange numbers and wouldn't really work in a sequence. "
ESTJ,"Why does he believe this, what supports this assumption? You got it backwards, you are caught in a circle of thinking ""I am searching for my identity, NFs do this, so I must be an NF"". Then you read stuff like this and say ""That is so true!"". Well of course. It is the same stuff you went through when deciding your type. The system has no value if all you try to do is find the box in which you fit best. "
ISTP,"Originally Posted by Roland787   Unfortunately, your mother won't allow me to so publicly address our affections    Is that your happy delusional fantasy? Are you into necrophilia too?"

ESFJ,Having common interests and someone to support you (or to support back) when times are tough.
ISTJ,"I didn't think that she was trying to hurt anyone, I was just wondering if her self-esteem issues were as big a deal as she made them. But it sounds like it's not unusual from what you guys are saying."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Results   How come you're all so scary?    I don't mean to state the obvious BUUGGHHT,"
ESTJ,"How do I explain to a dom Te- Si that it is fair to not want to follow a rule that is hindering my life? There is no one else who can lose other than myself, and that is a risk I am willing to take. Is this enough? I am at a loss here, I try to explain, but I can never seem to convince said person enough to let me be.    You're going to have to be a lot more specific. Can you provide contextual details?"
INTJ,Originally Posted by Epimer   Errm... I told you INTJ's could be wrong.     What was wrong with my spelling?
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Tentacular   I can't see how overthinking could be a problem. You're swimming pleasantly in a pool of ideas :)    As I said, my mood is crucial. If my mood is not the best, overthinking can easily bring me down. Especially if I can't find coherence with such thoughts haha"
ENTJ,- Highly logical and often mistaken for enneagram 5s.

Dammit Rivers... and so then the Pinkerton was good, the Blue was good, the Red was fucking fantactic... B-sides and all. so we form a diamond sea. And Kim replaced Karen,... karens voice was sad, and so was everything about her... when she died in '83 and reincarnated as that devil eyed satan lover, well maybe we went far. But alas, Kim Gordon rocked out, and sounded like Mary and wrote songs about Karen and that dude sung songs from Carpenters about Karen and the days rang on... oh the days rang on. "
ENFP,"These are all personal things that describe me...a little, and can't begin to paint the picture of who I am...nor will any answer paint a picture of all ENFPs....we all are similar in they way we process things, but the things which we choose to process and the ways in which we express ourselves and our feelings in relation to those things will change.

INTP,"Also, 80 bucks just to apply is ridiculous. I better get in for spending that much money. It's like betting on yourself. (I bet you $80 that I'll be one of the 35% who get accepted. [Oh, nope? You just lost $80 and your pride!!])    Wow, it was only about 30 in general when I was applying to college. But paying a fee to apply to college is ridiculous. It's like paying a publisher to read your book in order to have then even consider publishing it."

ISFJ,This one really resonates with me:) I don't feel like someone really knows me unless they get to see the crazy/strange side.
ENTJ,"But things don't always work out the way you planned.  A cancer diagnosis in my final year of college with a 10-20% survival rate prognosis, and a few years of fighting my illness and just trying to make it to the next day, (literally, yay, I didn't die today) taught me to value not only looking far enough ahead with your eye on the prize,  but also the value of having the courage and flexibility to completely revamp your plans  and change horses in mid-stream."

Omg, why are we so confusing?    Its gone from large volumes of sexual tension to equally large volumes of aggressive tension. She tried to hide it well but it leaks out from her body language quite easily."
