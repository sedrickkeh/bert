INFP,"Right now I'm running on 4 official hours of sleep and feel more energized than ever. I also had a rare non-nightmare which gave me a lot of insight regarding a situation in my life. Instead of my dreams being a temporary escape, I'm going to use it as a form of inspiration to take a proactive approach to life."
ESFP,What is alone time like for you... do you fill it up?
ENTP,Originally Posted by Psychological Euphoria   Do ENTP ever feel misunderstood?    Oh never.  EVERYONE always understands me.
ENFP,"My best friend is an ENFP and I'm trying to understand him, and it struck me as a tad bit unusual. "
ISTP,"My internet wanderings have taken me to another interesting place within the last 10 minutes. Have just been reading an *interesting* article about female empowerment and manipulating men. Excuse me, but I don't see anything empowering, for either sex, about manipulation (and belittling)."
INTJ,"I think that you somewhat answered my question, because you gave me a situation in which you acted in a way that might not have made sense to you at the time. "

ISTJ,"I'm not an angry person, I'm really not. But I've had enough bullcrap! Everytime I chill out, I get pulled right back in. This ENTJ is venting to her friend on the phone. I don't mean to eavesdrop, but these things happen. She's giving the whole ""I'm a sweet person, I don't deserve to get hurt, people are so judging of me. I love my friends but they're too hurtful to be around anymore."" Bullcrap! You wanna talk about hurtful? Let's see, how about making one friend cry twice? How about calling one friend abusive and self-absorbed? How about treating people awfully because they have more money then you? How about you acting like you're always right, and anyone that says you're wrong is a horrible person? Both people that you chased away are psychologically better now that they are out of your grasp, and you're complaining about what they did to you? I'll bet you $100 that at this rate you'll have zero good friends by the time you graduate! All it takes is your good friends to really get to know you before they run out of there. Has she ever really apologized for anything she's done? Not from what I've heard!"
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Happy about Nothing.   I feel pretty strongly about this one, I say ENFJ.    Yah ... I know now why exactly I'm having this trouble - based on a lot of discussion and also because of vivid's and Gildar's and your posts. "

ENFJ,"it's like everyone can just tell I stand out as someone who doesn't belong. I just wish everyone would magically like me. I wish I wasn't so weird. I just want my old friends back. I really miss them. it's not like we've fought or anything, we've just... drifted apart, as always seems to happen. *sigh*  Oh well. I'm sure I'll feel better soon, I always do."

I suppose you may not make any money, but I have a feeling that it's not about that to begin with.    I suggested that idea to my friend where I'd just pass him the videos and they get a professional to do the editing. They weren't so accepting towards the idea and more focused on who to blame..."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Happy about Nothing.   I remember one time I was really devastated because I was depressed and sleeping all the time and not eating a lot. I realized I was actually depressed about being depressed. When I came to accept it as a normal emotion, and let myself not be at my best, a lot of the stress was lifted and I felt a million times better. (Not saying this is the same thing you are going through, but just something to think about.) I hope you feel better overall soon. :]    Oh, the human mind... such a tricky little bastard. No that totally makes sense though. I just remembered I'm going to be hormonal for the next few days so I bet that has something to do with it too lol. Thanks for sharing that, though. I have a plan for the Fall semester that I think will help things, so I've just gotta hold out till then!"
ENTJ,"At the time my entp bestie had assumed her to be an ENFJ.  However under testing, she very strongly tested for Te and Ni.  Honestly, she lacked the grace and finesse in her manipulative attempts of the ENFJs I had know and I had assumed she was a 7w8 sx/sp entj. It was like she was trying to accomplish very Te goals but leaning extremely heavily on manipulation to get there.  Yet her manipulation was so transparent, it was almost icky.  Ill think back on her behaviors and maybe ENFJ will make more sense.    "
INTP,"I think I found a job I like (and I applied). And I think my chances might be improved because my dad used to work there (so random). But it's located in what I perceive to be the worst place to live, ever. I don't want to go back to my old hometown."
INTJ,The sacral and the root may reflect general INTJ attitudes towards socializing and emotion stuff.
ESFJ,"it upsets me quite a bit to see so many ESFJs feel wary about being on here. i would agree that ESFJs & Sensors in general do tend to be persecuted and get a lot of flak for their personality types unfortunately. i've only ever met one ESFJ to my knowledge, and although i can't say we're close, i'm sure there are many ESFJs - or just anyone, of any type - that are positively delightful and i look forward to meeting more of you and finding a friend in one or hopefully more! i really dislike it when someone meets one XXXX-type person and then generalises, ""oh, i don't get on with XXXXs, they're all <insert stereotype of your choice>"" and completely shuts themself off to the idea."
ISFJ,"So, yes, I relate to that. What I perceptually internalize, she externalizes. I like the difference in cognition, as most of the time it's not too jarring but instead refreshing. I don't think she and I could persistently tolerate each other for very long, though, because we don't have enough in common, we've different priorities, and our personal challenges are so seemingly disparate."
ESFJ,"well, esfj's opposite, the intp, get online 24/7, sooo........ "
ISFP,"I am proud that to say that I am not longer a quitter. I used to jump ship when the going got rough. When I was younger, I quit jobs I didn't like, only to take another job I didn't like either. I once quit a job by not showing up at all. It bothered me for years that I did this, but that's what I did. I used to skip a lot of my classes in college because I just didn't feel like going. I payed a dear price for that. I've realized that I can do any job as long as I keep a peace of mind and not think about what I don't like about it all of the time. I've learned to just ignore those people who take their misery out on me, not let them get to me. Rude people on the phone used to upset me quite a bit, but now I feel sorry for these people who seem to take things way too seriously. They can still upset me, just not as badly. Most importantly, I've just learned to do things in the best way that I can. If I have to go a little slower so the end result is better, then that's what I will do. I can't stand being rushed anyways. I've also learned to speak up for myself, well sort of. I used to just agree to whatever my employers needed me to do and then struggled with regrets until negative feelings boiled over and caused me to become angry or quit a job when it became too tough. I feel like such a douche bag speaking up for myself. It's like who am I to demand anything? I'm just glad that I've been able to sort through these feelings and realize how far I've come."

ISFP,I absolutely love the buttery feel of oil paints being worked onto a canvas.

Oh, I'm not completely socially retarded either. I have a circle of friends and we go do things. I do fine in public settings like at school (I essentially see the people as moving 'objects' so that buffers the introversion from going nuts) and the library. It is simply that unless with my friends who are strong Ns, my conversation ability with the majority of the world (Sensors), is handicapped. "

Unfortunately, that is the state of the world we live in. But there is kindness and beauty and so much good too. You won't find it by giving up on everyone and everything and convincing yourself that you could never be good enough for others. I don't even know you, and you're good enough to me.

INTP,"Memory supplies souls with a sort of following of one thing from another, which imitates reasoning, but which must be distinguished from it. It is like this. We see that, if animals have had a previous perception of something which struck them forcibly, when they later have a similar perception, the representation of it in their memory leads them to expect whatever was associated with it in the earlier perception, and to have feelings similar to the ones they had before. For example, when you show dogs the stick, they remember the pain it has caused them, and they bark or run away."

Wanting to dominate as a authority figure requires those who you will dominate upon. And , theoretically, you are always depending on others: ""Will they let you be the boss"". Well in school, sure. Kids are easily scared, but I find it SO fun to play with the power-seeking people. I ENJOY how they want to reduce my freedom, like they did with others, but how they can't.

As it turns out she has many, and once, I knew what I was doing and I knew what ""thread"" (no pun intended  ) to pull, but I started talking about something (on purpose) that reminded her of something from her love life and she started to cry. Yes, I agree, that's my Fe being overly manipulative, but if you had a weapon like this, you'd use it...    Your boastful actions indicate that  you are the one who is desparate for power, here.

ISTJ,Them:  But they (clerk's office) said you could help me with it!
ENFP,"Okay, okay, facts: ""we"" tend to like words, their shape and meaning, so it's a safe bet that we're into books, song lyrics, on-line forums, conversation, and such.  We also tend to be ""artsy"", so anything artistic is good, too.  Also, we're all about authenticity and self-expression, so watching others being themselves is also a turn-on."
ENTP,"But if confronted to a sociopath INFJ, the ENTP could enjoy playing with these imaginary ppl as building blocks to start fucking with INFJ's mind :D"
ESTP,"- When you were in elementary school and middle school, you JUST COULDN'T understand why your classmates could be sooo miserable when they received a bad grade, some even cried. why?? You were always one of the top student in class, but sometime you got even super bad grades, you didn't like it but it didn't bother you much, just a one time mistake. But it was seriously annoying watching people cried because of grade.  "

ISFJ,"Just last week, an ISFJ friend told me that she sent a note to someone who usually responds right away, and didn't hear from him for a week, so she spent the entire week analyzing and re-analyzing her letter, wondering if she had offended him or been inappropriate -- but as it turns out, he had a work backlog and didn't even see it until three days later."
ENTP,"I choose 2, and I'd try the eyeballs, and if they taste bad I'll spit them out on the table."
INFP,"I honestly do not get what people want from me. I've tried being nice, I've tried being sarcastic. I've tried being myself, I've tried being someone else. I've fucking bought stuff that I don't particularly want so I have something extra in common with that person. I've tried being enthusiastic, I've tried playing it cool. Seriously, just..."
INTP,"Supposedly, a new drug may have caused some of these incidents. After seeing a good number of drug threads here, I can only assume that the apocalypse will begin with the majority of INTPs finally turning into Hannibal Lectar."
ESTJ,"Now for this post: I mostly have this problem, when I need to depend on another person, who doesn't do what he was supposed to. Sometimes, I need the help of others and if they aren't doing anything and are just standing in the way, I tend to get very impatient.    We actually wouldnt mind answering that or at least I wouldnt. I would just answer the questions and ignore the last remark. But I get what you are saying. Also I already read on the descriptions. They were not helpful and as I said before I do forget things. "

ENTJ,"Example: I volunteer as a Child Advocate for the foster care system. My Fi makes me passionate about somehow helping these children (ENTJs can often have ""savior complexes""), and Te allows me to be very good at representing these children in court and deal with the paperwork, investigative work, organization, and ultimately the advocacy itself. I am not very good at sitting around and listening to people talk and comforting them (we are not nurturers), but I can see a problem and figure out how to solve it in a practical sense."

Could barely do my homework, sometimes didn't finish.) me to get braces while inflicting more and more unfair punishments. "

INFP,"Did some volunteer work for a special community service day at my university. I was digging holes for a garden in the legit ghetto. That was okay, I like working hard for a cause, even in the Alabama sun. I know I need more experiencing digging holes if I want to be an archaeologist, anyway. Plus, we were helping prettify a very ugly neighborhood. It only cost me about 5 hours of my day, 7 blisters, and aches in every imaginable bone and muscle in my body. Not too bad."

Caught her a few times while at the library....and I think she knows I know about her. There were occasions where she'd be walking away and looking, and she'd turn away abruptly as soon as I'd turn. Had the same thing happen on the elevator on a fair number of occasions. >.<"

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Grainy   Personally, I fall in love with the person, not the circumstances, at least to a certain extent. I'm open to long distance if I meet a person who's worth it, though I obviously would prefer to meet someone who lived near me. This has cost me dearly, as some people really avoid long distance at all costs, including a guy I truly believed wanted the same thing I did.    Well yes, proximity is important for practical reasons but I'm being completely fanciful and impractical for the sake of potential romance.    I was just interested in ISFJ opinions on long distance relationships and that situation was the most extreme example I could think up.   "

ISTJ,"Someone that is normally on-time and honors their commitments I would of course make an exception for; someone that does this all the time needs to be taught a lesson.    Well, here's the odd thing about this guy. He's very good about being on time when he's got nothing better to do. He's almost never a few minutes behind, in fact sometimes he's been right on the dot. So he has no problem with the idea of being on time. But he also has no problem blowing me off for something more ""important."" At least he's telling me now. Last year, we would eat dinner every night together at the dining hall. I would usually wait at my dorm until he got off work, which he would let me know by texting me. Sometimes though, he would eat with his roommates, which is fine. But he wouldn't tell me. Considering that I wait until he texts me to eat, I obviously would be pretty hungry by the time I texted him asking what was going on. Whereupon I would get a text saying that he ate with his roommates. One time we made a plan of when to eat, and I headed there and waited for 15 minutes. I finally texted him and he said that he already ate with his roommates. "

The robots of life.    I know how you feel. My last year was a repeat of the year before, redoing my coursework and exams because I failed them so badly the first time. Now I'm approaching actually finishing my work and getting ready for my final exams. It feels like I'm just forever repeating myself, and I don't see the point. When I get annoyed with myself for not finishing stuff and not doing well I always realise how pointless it all is, how formulaic and controlling it can be."

ISFJ,"I thought that ISFJ are really aware about other people feeling. And care a lot for others. But his reation just irritated me. Didnt he think about what he has done or its just a small issue, which seems big for me but not for him? And how should I continue?    It is possible to be aware of how other people are feeling, but not understand the reason behind it. Personally I get emotionally exhausted occasionally and have very little energy left for people, I can at times like this find it difficult to take other peoples emotional sharing and respond in an appropriate way. In situations like this I will listen attentively, but may find I have nothing to contribute at the time."
INFJ," And every time someone is like, Oh wow, you look so young! oh wow, you act so young. "
ESTJ,"I am not saying you think like that.

Essentially my main problem today was that nobody else had a sense of urgency except my department, who busted their asses today, and it feels like nobody appreciates the bigger picture enough sometimes. I get told that I should've shipped x, y and z because they're easy, to which I counter with, I thought it was more important to get the largest portion of orders out rather than get hung up on the small details. Some people seemed to think we'd get something like 75 orders out, very unrealistic considering our average has been 30-40. We managed 50-60, which I think is pretty damn good. It's easy, then, for me to start feeling like nothing I do is good enough, because there's always someone saying, but what about this? "
ESFP,"EDIT: I have realised what was the reason I even started thinking about this. It seems that I have a huge amount of guilt when it comes to expressing myslef. So, I was unconsciously trying to find a reason for not expressing myslef.    The point of expressing yourself is to be human, to be really alive and not silenced by anyone or anything.  To be free!"

The other there is no thought, nothing exists in the world other than the music at hand, its alive and breathing, it's me.

And I'm also confessing that I'm my parents' bitch. I can't seem to break away from them no matter how hard I try. I love them dearly, but they're restricting me and hurting me in ways they can't even begin to imagine, but there's no way I can even begin to imagine saying goodbye to them because I couldn't ever hurt them like that. So, until I break the barriers in my own mind, I'm stuck living their lies. I will change, but I haven't figured out how yet. I like to think I'll do it after college, but I feel like, if I don't get down to business right now, I'll just keep pushing it back, and before I know it, I'll be a bitter, average 50 year old (an age I didn't really plan on living to anyways...)"
ISFJ,"It's a pitfall for ISFJ to need, need, need things from other people to the point of being clingy because of aux. Extraverted Feeling, but when you're type 5 you learn to get by on very, very little -- and substitute for what you lack by compensating with other things."

ESTP,"In 2011 this guy emailed me on an OKCupid. He said in his note that he went to browse his matches by match percentage, and I was the first person to come up... we were a 99% match with each other, and he wanted to get to know me better. I live in New York, he lives in LA. I thought he was crazy messaging me across the country, haha. I gave him my Facebook and phone and we have kept in touch over the years. He is an ESTP. I have never met him. But after four years of talking, I know we'd get along so well. I have a serious crush on this guy. We are both ambitious, business owners, have the same sets of values, positive outlook on life, set of humor... Everytime we talk he bugs me, When are you coming to LA?! He also gets pretty um, sexually explicit with what he'd like to do with me. We have wonderful banter together and he laughs at everything I say. He ends all his sentences in winks and hearts. I am always the initiator of conversations, I can't tell whether he's uninterested or just so busy with his 20 businesses he owns that he can't keep track of me. He works part time as a photographer and hangs out with every pretty model in LA, why he talks to me is beyond me. He also never asks me personal questions about myself so I feel like he doesn't actually care about me, but then he will randomly say something about a conversation we had years ago and I'm like ""Whuuttt how did you remember that?"" Sighhhhh. I need to meet this guy."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by General Lee   I do not believe that I speak too quickly but however I have been told many times to slow down. The problem is that when I slow down I speak with such a slow and somber tone that people are both amazed that I am going slow and scared at how somber my slow tone of voice is.    Can't you just speak in a fashion that is understandable and upbeat? I mean, we do speak so that people understand us, and we also don't want to seem uncomfortable in the manner in which we speak. I wouldn't think this would be an issue."
ESFP,"I think an INTJ makes a good rudder for an ESFP in a storm.

Thanks! I dont mind the friend box. I'm not good at naturally getting close to people, but with ESFPs I still feel at home cause they dont judge.

ISTJ,"The ISTJ forum tends to be a bit more PC, having a no-nonsense and serious feel to it, because you have a bunch of inspectors running around making sure everything is ""right."" It's in our nature so you can easily observe it through various comments we make to each other and outsiders. As a part of this, you will find other types feel comfortable and at ease posting in this forum, because we tend to prefer structure, dislike randomness, and tend to be welcoming of everyone that shows maturity in their words and style of posting."
ENTJ,"what I find offensive is the constant barrage of questions that can be summed up like this "" How do I get type ABC to see my perspective/do what I want?"" The question isn't the problem but the unspoken lack of the Poster's  basic ability to accept/understand that two MBTI types can see the same situation in such a different way that the two views would have less in common than that of a blind person and a sighted one.

It's like, if they keep yanking on it, it'll somehow open faster.  It's a strange mentality.  When I come in, first thing I do is hit the automatic door opener... if the door's unlocked, it opens... if not, it doesn't.  Then I push the call button & hit the auto door opener again this causes the door to automatically open immediately when control releases the lock.  Easy peasy.  Of course, I'm not also not always rolling into work 3 seconds before I'm supposed to clock in, either... "

ESTP,"This is just me, but I would try to get the ESTP distracted with a new toy, perhaps its another relationship(Yes I know it's wrong to say a person is a toy, but the point here is in the distraction,because we love to be distracted...at least I do), that might bring relief on the INFP girl.

ISFP,"Thanks!    I initially connect with people who strike up a conversation about a similarity we have. What makes me feel great about our interaction is when they ask me questions about how I feel and think about things, and then give me ample time to respond. I'm very aware of not taking up more than my share of the conversation, I don't like the feeling of forcing my voice in, and I feel acutely aware of stopping before I sense that someone is bored, but unfortunately that often ends up in me feeling like I had a 2-hour-long hangout with an extrovert and they didn't get to know me whatsoever."
ENTJ,"All others said everything that was important in this topic and I agree with them. We know ourselves and we know what's the best for us. If the relationship is worth it, we work for it, if it isn't, we quit it. Holding grudges is pointless and a waste of time. People who aren't willing or capable to move on or talk over the issues will bring a lot of emotional and drama baggage into the relationship and our Te doesn't want to deal with that. Unless he asks for your help directly, let him solve his issues the way he considers it the best. ENTJs aren't sentimental. If we feel like something might help us in the long run we will do it even if it hurts us in the short run."
ISFP,"I'm trying to work up the motivation to go to the gym in the morning before work. It's something I really want to do and it excites me, but instead I'm giving into my desire to stay up late and do other things that motivate me far less with no long term pay out, thus leading me to be too tired to wake up early enough to workout."
ENFJ,"You also mentioned that most importantly, you examine the relationship objectively to see if it is healthy.  As an ENFJ, I find the true infatuation to be with the process of examining the validity of our relationships.  We are always gauging other people's feelings especially in relationships because we strive for balance and as a Leo, I need to know that I'm being the best Lion in the wild (if you know about Leos you'll get what I mean by this) and if not, it is instantly because of something we're doing or not doing. (ENFJ + Leo = taking fault for things that don't go correctly but viewing it as a noble act especially when we aren't at fault)""While I enjoy a happy, stable relationship that is mutually reciprocal,  if it's ~too~ stable, and ~too~ rational, I feel as though I begin to  lose interest.""As an ENFJ, I tend to find balance in imbalance.  I want to take on other people's problems to the point where I literally become like a light house, constantly searching for lost vessels to bring back home so I wind up with girls with various problems, ""damaged goods"" as some people are brave enough to call them and if I find a girl with no problems, I almost feel like I search for one to give validity to me even being with them because in my eyes, there are too many broken individuals and too few self-aware ENFJ's on this planet for me to be spending time with someone living the ""perfect life"". ""This is particularly important for me because I've been burned way way  too many times, and have the need to be cautious because I know how  severe the consequences are if I let someone in to my inner self who  (whether intentionally or not) will probably hurt me."""

ISFJ,"We enjoy joking around, and will generally try to laugh at any jokes (no matter how bad), but it doesn't generally have any more meaning than keeping everybody happy, i think"
ENTJ,1.  My ENTJ is more concerned with results than how the results are obtained whereas my Mum needed to know that the correct processes and procedures where adhered to.  This always left me feeling second best because my Si is so low compared with hers - there was literally no way I could measure up to her standards.  Not her fault... it is who she is... but damn it is hard going when you haven't yet discovered MBTI Types and have no common language to address the disparity.

You need to let me go, we could never be friends after everything you did to me."
ENTJ,"I meant emotional manipulation in the ""they're very good at using feels to get what they want"". It's not that other types couldn't do it, it's more the Fe-Fi thing.

XD Still feel this way to a degree, but only when I have nothing I am working towards. If you have no goals, no vision, you will be bored to tears, and to depression. Don't let that happen. Find some way to interrupt / distract those feelings enough to think about what you want out of life. You don't have to know what you want to be / do 5 years from now or even 1 year from now. Just ask yourself: what is fulfilling to me? Doing little things in that genre will make you feel purposeful and more sure of yourself. Try new things, meet new people. If you like to read, research about things you find interesting. Learn more about other people; the more you learn about others, the more you'll learn about yourself and what it means to be you. And if you need someone to talk to / vent, hit me up. I will listen and help in any way I can.    This is so true. I think long term goals are nice and all,  but if I get too involved or too detailed, it only leads to disappointment and depression. "

I only let people see me cry over things like movies. It can be a wonderful way to connect to something and let loose without feeling like you shouldn't be crying. Like its justified or something. A friend commented once and said that she noticed I liked sad things. I guess that makes sense. It gives me a way to channel those emotions into something external. It's easier. "
ISTJ,@Kayness :  That was like the Sasquatch (someone with REALLY big feet - saw the footprints in the snow the next morning) that came during the ice storm that nailed me in February and ripped me off of about just under a dollar in change from my car and swiped six CD's.

There does seem to be some sensitivity lacking in the narrative, perhaps because some people have been bulldozed or hurt by an ESTJ, but what I find very interesting reading through this forum is that this is the place where you can ask someone why they would behave that way. Did my boss make me cry because she's a mean person and gets off on seeing others cry? Or maybe was there another explanation? Doesn't change how you felt at that moment, but maybe if you understood a little more behind others reasoning for behaving certain ways, you could be a little more patient, or avoid conflict altogether."

I'll think, ""Oh, I need to do this, I better make that call today, but I'll grab my coffee first."" And then two weeks later be like, ""Oops... damn... got distracted with other things and forgot."" I've made spreadsheets to help me remember (very pretty and well organized spreadsheets) but that lasted all of one month before I started getting distracted with other things and forgetting to keep up with on a day to day basis... anyone have any advice? Do I need to like... just marry an ISTJ or something?    Try not to overwhelm yourself with a million things you should do. Focus on one thing and do it. Take things one step at a time, because getting overwhelmed with things you think you SHOULD be doing but aren't will ultimately leave you feeling very dejected and not good about yourself. At least that's true for me from my own experience with procrastinating things that should be done."
ISTP,"I'd probably stand there and glare, or stand there and start venting loudly to myself, staying away from the stupid person. (I can see it now, me screaming ARE U FKING KIDDING ME!

My older sister is the Oldest; my brother is the Only Boy; my little sister is the Baby of the family. What's that make me? They all were privileged with some sort of ""perk"" or another if you will, which I wasn't. And I felt this early on even before my little sister was born and it was us first three. I learned at a young age that I kinda had to work to get what they got somehow, and feeling so different from everybody at the same time was a little lonely at times if I wasn't able to ignore the facts.    pm'd you...."

ISTP,"I must be getting better, because I can now feel my usual low-level simmering rage. I've been so drained I've been incapable of getting annoyed or angry, even with stupid people. Once again I'm reminded I basically have two settings: a happy/neutral (probably described more accurately as ""content"") or aggro. "
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by lordmercurio   Scams has been part of society from long time ago, not much new; perhaps the new thing its the system used to get the money; howefver its not that creative  compared with other stuff.So lets make the list about this topic:"
INTJ,"Originally Posted by sysha    Now it may be a specific case, but I have come across a few who seemed to thrive on feeding gullible people a whole lot of bull to achieve their own ends, tugging their emotional strings if the infallible ""logic"" trap doesn't work.    I love convincing gullible people of the most crazy things ever (like trivia/background about cultural stuff or myself), but I just do it for fun and tell them shortly after that it was all false. Well, if I don't burst out in laughter in the middle of my story."
INTJ,"It's just a matter of ""painting what you see,"" though... You do need references. There are people who can draw things off of the top of their heads but those are people who practice drawing the same things over and over so that they can draw what's in their head without using a reference. It's not cheating to look at something!"
ISFP,"Will you be the one to re-initiate conversation? Suppose there's a scenario where the particular person won't re-initiate conversation. How long should I wait to recontinue speaking, and what should I say or do?    The thing is, it happens rarely that someone pushes me to this kind of behavior. More often it can be that I retreat from a discussion that is becoming too sensitive (I mean the person is emotional about the subject or overly convinced that he or she is right and does not give good arguments for the opinion) because then there's the risk of feeling attacked myself and becoming emotional as well. I'll always try to stay polite and not hold it against them. If this would have been the case with you, there isn't really damage done and you can talk to this person (about something else) any time and then bring the subject up in a more neutral way, I think."

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Eylrid   There are some people who really need medication, but, by and large, it's way overrated.    For psychological pills, I agree completely. However, me and painkillers are best buds. You guys are much better troopers than me. But then I only get pain from menstrual cramps, tension headaches, or my frequent sinus headaches. I haven't taken painkillers for anything else since the 8th grade when I got an infected toe. And you're right, it does cover up the pain even if it is getting worse. I went in to get it checked out on a Monday when the nurse practitioner told me it was infected. She told me to come in on Wednesday to see if it would get better or not with prescribed antibiotics. On Monday and Tuesday, I took Aspirin as well as the antibiotics and was excited that it wasn't really hurting anymore. On Wednesday it turned out that it was even worse, and against my protesting that it was feeling better, she took the nail off."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Willy   Hahaha thanks bethdeth, very supportive indeed, I am smiling right now. lol :P But I might like to share that I practice ballet and my point/tippy toe nullifies the height difference when standing face to face :D    You could do what one of my dates did and pull her by the neck until she is your height."
ESFP,"Originally Posted by visionarypioneer   Where are some places you guys like to meet up? Are you guys more of a night life or early bird gets the worm type of person? Also what would make an ESFP want to chat with an introvert?    Generally my time with people is spent in the afternoon. My friends and I just meet up at local restaurants, each other's houses, and at church. "
ESTJ,"I think I'll take a few strong and obvious rules, a lot of freedom, surrounded by a lot of love all the time. *note to self: not being too protective*"
ISFP,"On the other hand, there have been times when I've felt so, like, adored. It's so absurd. It's like I can't reconcile those fading memories with other things she's said and done."

INTP,Does it have a guy with a mustache in it?    It might? Mostly it's a bald dude and his two daughters.
ISTJ,"I am seriously getting tired of Lady Gaga. She is irritating me in the worst way. She is a huge hypocrite and needs to learn that you can't be both an activist and insulting to a majority of the population (aka. being an activist for homosexual rights but insulting religion). Now, normally I wouldn't care, there are lots of annoying singers out there, I just ignore them. Often my approach to celebrities anyway is that no matter what they do, if they produce something I enjoy, I will buy it. I do have two Lady Gaga songs on my iPod. My biggest problem with Lady Gaga is that she's treated like some epic popstar that will go down in history. Give me a break, her songs are completely lyrical based now, she puts no real effort in actual music. Yes, good lyrics are wonderful to have. But there are six parts to composing music, and lyrics is not one of them. The first time I hear a song, I don't listen to the lyrics. In fact, if I like a song, I will write down unique lyrics so that I can google the song later. Anyway, that's the end of my rant."
ISFJ,"And she knows all this, but doesn't do anything at all! Argh. I don't get that mindset at all, and I don't need to, but when you have a problem and keep whinning about it, without actually doing anything, and ignoring peoples' advice - after saying they're absolutely right of course, and you're going to do as they say - I don't see what to do with this situation other than stop bothering, which I can't that easily, cos they're my friend. Is it an attention thing? Do they need validation or something?    Amazingly this was a one-to-one description of my mother. She works herself to exhaustion by taking care of everyone who's remotely close to her, and by making the problems of everyone in her family her own. so first thank you for explaining the problem so well. "
ENFP,"When an ENFP loses hope, he/she really loses the drive to succeed... It's a formed of learned helplessness... And self punishment even though you are not at fault.  But you can't give up. "
ISFJ,"I think it depends on what ""proper"" means to you and how you arrived on something being proper.  It seems like ""proper"" is more of an Fe thing, just because it tends to be more of a learned value.  Proper usually seems to be based on culture and society to me.  In my experience, Fi users don't care as much about something being proper...they seem to be fine with everyone doing what's right for them as long as it doesn't directly affect others.  Fe users tend to adopt social and cultural norms and rules and tend to prefer that everyone adheres to them."
ISFP,"I am starting to think I am an INTP again.  It's been a while since I considered this since I was typed by a professional, but can't help think maybe my depression threw them off which wouldn't be too surprised since I thought I was an INFP during that time.  But the nagging ""what if"" keeps popping in my mind.  ""What if"" I had a internal bias due to feeling and thinking too inadequate to be an INTP.  I am just unsure.  Perhaps more research is needed.  Or even an inquisition of myself to poke and prod the info and data needed from me to come up with a conclusion.  But I maybe be able to deceive myself or others."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by jeb713   Oh my     Completely unrelated to the thread, but I totally read this in George Takei's voice. :P And I completely forgot Stargate existed until I saw your profile pic. Haven't seen anything Stargate related in YEARS. I seriously miss that show."
ISFJ,How do I know if a friendship with an ISFJ is over? What are some signs?
ENFP,"2. She holding his phone, messaging back and he allowing it without or taking the phone from her or messaging you back ""sorry for that"" "
ISTJ,"If there exists some detailed internet articles, then I am sorry that I don't know them at persent and won't search them for you. If you wish, you can read up on the above mentioned topics on internet to give you some basic knowledge."
ENFJ,"Haven't done much since. But yeah..... I'm thinking long term now. I have a 5/10/15 year outline because this teacher messaged me on fb a week ago, too, and I started thinking. But now he's pushing."

ENTJ,"I hate being asked how I would feel if I was in someone else's shoes, especially when it's an attempt to make me emphatize with another person's crappy situation. For the most part they're situations where I would never be stupid enough to find myself in. But, yet again, I can't say that so it's another dead-end question where the person's not looking for my genuine opinion."
ENFP,That oesn't make me less extrovert as this doesn't mean necessarily we have to be social ALL THE TIME ! its about our perception of the world that is outwards not inwards
ENTP,"Originally Posted by roughestimate   My grandpa has intentionally grown mold on isolated loaves of bread in his home because penicillin is known to occupy such things.

INFJ,"I don't get any of it, myself.  I don't care what anybody believes or whom they worship.. whatever puts the wind in your sails.  But to me the belief in such things is so illogical and irrational that I can't even begin to wrap my head around why they believe.  ::shrugs::"

By the way, I thought your mom bought it, not your in-laws...Anyway, it seems to me, this feeling comes from inside and is also maintained by you...you could try to put on a piece of paper the things that would make your life better and start making some small steps towards that.

But I don't like confrontations. I don't know any type that likes them, and that's not necessarily an ENFP thing, but if someone takes the confrontation on themselves, then I will respond truthfully, sometimes without tact, but always without any agendas.

When you start second guessing Ni and or the walk, you become consciously aware of it, you start to walk funny because you are focusing your attention on something that you do unconsciously without a thought, it's a very auto-pilot type of behavior. Likewise, I can see how Te can be problematic, yet very necessary for Ni dominants and it's also why I advocate some type of creative outlet. If you have no outlet, you run into the unhealthy territory, where things become bottlenecked.

Although there were other contributing factors to me not really wanting to go there in the first place, I decided then and there that if my first choice or even the other school I didn't really want to go to didn't accept me, I'd simply rather take another year off.    Oh, I believe you. Especially about the pretentiousness. And what makes it funny is that they are so focused on the things they hate that nobody else gives a fuck about. My boyfriend lives in an upscale community just north of the Chicago Loop that is primarily inhabited by these hipsters and I hate going outside when I'm there, although I'm safer there than anywhere else in the city. Even when I'm just walking around downtown here in Chicago, hipsters are so easy to spot and it's painful for me to even be around them."

ESFP,"Originally Posted by sparkles   Milkshakes, be direct. Tell your friend, you think he might like this girl, and out of respect for both of them you're intervening to say he needs to let it go.    Is there anything I'll need to watch out for- any way I could possibly step wrong and hurt his feelings? A lot of people already know he likes her (the INFP girl and her boyfriend included)- he's not exactly shy about it. I'm concerned he might have heard this thing before, as he's liked her for quite some time now: probably for more than a year. The only reason he never struck up a relationship with her, I believe, is because the ESTP ex probably would've slaughtered him. -.-"

But sometimes he's perfectly fine! Im so confused!! Ive been noticing this going on since say, the holidays, but I havent said anything because i dont want to scare him away.

I love seeing people defeat their problems, to go on to more happiness.    I like to see them defeat their problems, but I find myself unable to help them because they'll just keep rejecting whatever word I say and keep whining and sinking lower and lower, possibly telling me ""oh thank you, that's such a good advice! you saved me on this one!"" so you'll expect the problem to be fixed after that, but then they come crying again, and  I say ""I thought we had already fixed this..."" and I realize that they didn't do anything that I told them to do."

ENTP,"Originally Posted by IDontThinkSo   Long story short, you're way more lenient with female ENTPs.    Ironically, I find that this is often not the case in life. A lot of the ENTP qualities that I express in life and work (bluntness, exact, not seeking but not afraid of confrontation, authoritative, etc.) are things not the norm for women, and people assign unflattering adjectives to me due to them. With men, they are expected and often encouraged.

It's hard enough talking to another guy I don't know, but when its a girl... I am a complete idiot. I really get that thread about how guys get dumber talking to beautiful women. It really bothers me that for one reason or another the befriending challenge largely extends to even online, where I am much more social. Do people hate me? Am I invisible? "
INFJ,"Really wish people would stop dragging me into their orbits of insanity.  Ugh.  Seriously.  Spent 30 minutes on the phone dealing with someone else's issues.

ISFP,"I just feel so bad for her, because her genetics have been against her ever since she was a small child, so it's difficult for her to be at a normal weight.  Everyone on her dad's side of the family has weight issues.  When she was only moderately overweight, she had been starving herself instead of following a proper exercise / diet routine.  I don't know what to do.  We've been on the verge of breaking up so many times, and she's tried to reassure me that she would never kill herself if she was forever alone, but I don't fully believe it.  It's so fucking depressing.  Minus her tendency to be a slob (I've learned to let it go), we're a great couple, but after 5 years, my patience is wearing thin, and I'm sick of fantasizing about other people."

The only time she's liked and commented my posts is when she's drunk or high. I also get the feeling that she posts things related to me, hoping I will like or comment on it. Is this something an ENFP is likely to do? I don't understand why she posts subliminal hints, but acts oblivious to me.

I am currently working on my relationship with an INTP and, as you can probably figure out, we have some serious problems, but we're both willing to solve them. My question is - how do you deal with lack of reassurance from other types? I mean, I know that I won't hear from my INTP that he loves me every 5 minutes and while I'm trying to be reasonable and I'm telling myself that of course he loves me, otherwise why would he be with me, why would he do all those little things for me that he does, I need some way to deal with the fact that deep down I'd love to hear that he loves me every 5 minutes. Maybe the problem lays in my self-consciousness, my lack of self-worth? (I don't feel well with myself, I wish I was better, smarter, prettier, thinner, funnier... you name it.) What do you think?    It is the most deceptive emotion - love. You go through life thinking love comes from others and into you, or from you into others. But eventually you will see that the person that you've been wanting to love you all along has been you. Love is not how you feel about others... it is how you feel about yourself. Once you realize this, you want other people to also feel about themselves the way you do. The whole dynamic changes... It stops being about sacrifice and hardship and will power, and becomes all about emotional authenticity, happiness, and peaceful accommodations. Love is truthfully feeling good, not faking it.

ENTJ,ENTJs probably seem like the most likely to forgo children for career advancement and practicality. Personally having kids is probably part of the grand scheme of things for me. Any preference?    I don't want children and I'm fortunate that I have a younger brother who is enthusiastic about having (at least 2 kids) so my ISFJ mom can be a grandmother (it's a lifelong dream of hers). The INFP I dated and almost married was indifferent about having kids but in retrospect I'm unsure if that was due to true indifference or the fact that she didn't have her life together and couldn't have supported and raised one financially and emotionally even if she wanted them.

INFJ,I think doorslamming is a wonderfully vague metaphor.  There are many types!  
ISFJ,"@Vwoop  - Not sure I flinch when falling in video games, but you should check out our video game topic which is so awesome :P I should probably bring it back since Gears 3 is out now (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"
ENTP,To find god since he will fix it for you    He gave me faculty to own my problems so he can focus on all the screw ups who need to rely on him
ISTP,"I hate this game. But I also love it so much.    an underrated game on an extremely underrated console. Managed to play it on a 'trip' yesterday as well and yeah, definitely approaches dark souls difficulty, maybe a bit more."
ISFJ,Originally Posted by MrDrEvilPorkchop   I have to say thank you to everyone who has posted something on this thread. Ive had a tough few weeks and I can always come on here to laugh and cry for awhile. You guys have helped me see there are other people who think the same way and do the same things. I cant write in words the support Ive gotten from just reading these posts.
ESFP,"Although I'm not ESFP, I have a recent ex-boyfriend who is and my brother, whom I'm close to is as well.  On the surface, they appear to be the same, but because of very different life experiences, they express basic things like enjoying life to its fullest, showing others a good time in very different ways."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Napoleptic   What's with all the drunken INTJs lately?    Hey baby, it's not alcohol doing this... it's years of sexual deprivation."
INFP,"clearly i'm in a horrid mood right now...    I'm sorry, Jolene. I'm one of those cowardly men you speak of. The first girl who ever loved me; I used her. I cried to her about my problems, I masturbated when talking to her on the phone (and she knew), but I refused to even hold her hand when she wanted me to, because I didn't want to be seen in an intimate fashion with a girl who looked like her (chubby and pimply) in public."
ISFJ,"And I've only ever met nice people, so I still kinda think that everyone's nice, despite studying forensic psychology and obviously knowing that you're speaking the truth when it comes to statistics    Well that's good.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by cake   When would you start calling somebody ""babe"" ""hun"" ""sweetie"" or ""cutie""?    "
INFJ,"As long as I keep trying, I'll be alright.  Things really do work out most of the time..."
ESFJ,"3. You say ""thank you"" and ""no problem"" ALL THE TIME FOR EVERY LITTLE THING (cause you know it makes you feel good when others do)."
ENFJ,"One of the things I dislike is when my roommates leave me notes suggesting to do things around the house. I feel like it's passive agressive, especially the way the notes are worded sometimes. My roommate left a note by the sink today that was taped to the counter and in bold print said, ""All Dishes Need to Be Rinsed before they are Put in the Sink."" To which I asked her, ""What is this about?"" and she angrily told me how irritated she was that the dishes weren't rinsed out....."
ESFJ,Originally Posted by Cool Beans   Hahah all the other types are answering for us! Which is strange because esfj is a common type! 
ISFJ,"Her reaction sounds odd if that's the case, but i guess I'd still feel that i had to be civil to someone i didn't want to talk to"
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by joup   So if this person happened to be in a place (country) where it is considered illegal, will you then only have an opinion on it? And what will it be?    You cannot make a sexuality illegal, just expressing it. Though, I admit, I phrased it wrongly, as long as it doesn't harm anyone and it isn't considered a crime under the current laws of the country I live in. If the laws change to harm/discriminate against a selected group (e.g bisexuals), they would be wrong and so they wouldn't change my mind. Does that explain it?"
ENTP,"If you're female, I don't have any advice. Maybe start making videos of encounters and we'll provide tips as necessary."
INFP,"So this girl I was hanging out with for a few months is now dating this rapper she does promotional art for. Jealousy aside, it does not bother me as much, and that is surprising. We have so much in common, share the same sense of humor, like were really compatible, but I know she wants more, and I don't feel like I have anything to give, she wants my heart but I don't have one to give her. That's why I'm not too messed up about it. I know it's probably for the best cuz I would only hurt her anyway."
ENFJ,"But she apologised for shouting at me, and explained that she was angry at the school for effectively punishing those who can do things early, and she was annoyed because everyone in the family always says things far too late."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Eylrid   I had a few stuffed animals as a kid. Got to find friends somewhere, right?"
INTP,Why do they bother making scissors in so many different sizes? They all do the same thing.
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by ToughLilCookie   Who knows.  I've read the same, but with today's media it's really hard to tell what is part true, all true or just more sensationalism.  I liked the base principles of Rand Paul a lot, and he's been pushed back with little coverage.  The more the candidates screech, are outlandish and are media-driven, the more people seem to be swayed.  The principles of governing are my concern more than the showmanship of the candidate anyway.  For example, the car discussion above:  I don't think the government should be in the business of telling us what we should drive to begin with.  Their job is to govern and uphold law, not to mold our society into a homogeneous urban culture that they cannot see beyond.   I just don't get this ""government is our parents"" thing at all.    Not if you actually read the fucking studies. Or at least take 10 minutes out of your day to read the god damn abstracts."
ISFJ,"When i call in sick at work, i sound really cheery on the phone (to be polite), and they have a hard time believing i'm not well"
ISFJ,"Me: No, you saw Little Miss Sunshine on your first date."
INFP,"Originally Posted by rowingineden   I hope many PerC members will (Facebook link) -> wear purple tomorrow <- (/Facebook link) to show love, support, and acceptance for GLBT youth. Love can save lives.     Yup, yup. Thank you for linking that here, I hadn't seen anything about it on my Facebook or twitter or whatnot. :-)"
ENFP,"Well the thing is I can have a dark thought but not have it cause me any pain, more than likely I went off on some tangent in my head that somehow landed on something dark without the intention so whats the point of bringing it up if its not causing me any pain if bringing it up could cause the other person pain? (according to the previous poster I asked of course :) ) "
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Serenitylala   Hmmm.... Now that's a dilemma one site says INFJ and the other says ESFJ. What to believe?

Hes not extroverted, and remember INFJs are the most extroverted of all introverts and look at Cog functions. I mean even the recent Captain America movies show hes INFJ :P."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by AyaSullivan   It might be. Depends on the ENFP and the people that are around him/her and if he/her feels that person needs a hug. Usually hugs mean a lot to an ENFP.    Hugs are very significant to me, and I'm not promiscuous with them - but am very open and willing to give/receive. The main thing is that it has to be warm and real - that little tendril of openness."
INTJ,"Sometimes I scare myself a little.    BC u r so good with looking at the facts, filling in the blanks with what possibilities may fit the facts, and then sit back for the global view of it all.... use it all the time in my line of work..I'm happy with ni..you rock you nailed it!!!!"
ENFJ,"Perhaps I need a break... but the one week I get from semester to internship, i'm going to go back and see my grandma some more. Hell, it might be the last time I get to. All these burdens are just weighing down on me so much and I'm literally dragging me feet to this finish line. "

ISFP,"Q2 - Number 1 for sure. I never follow trends anyway. If I wear something that's trendy, it's purely coincidental because I buy something if I find it pretty. I just wear whatever I like. I'd be embarrassed and uncomfortable to wear something I didn't like. Not to mention I'd feel like I'm not being true to my self and not genuine."

INFJ,Originally Posted by Ava82   Fact is.. our economies are built on a growing population. Greying populations are a massive issue economically. 
INTJ,"an INTP.* And I don't mean in the bedroom sense either.    I don't consider myself inflexible. I don't stick with an opinion just because it's mine. If something else is shown to be right then I correct my views on the subject at hand instead of, as I've seen too often with others, continue arguing for ""my"" views with whatever relevant and irrelevant argument I can think of plus some bullshit to add flavor."
INFP,But you keep on trying to make it work when in the long run it's not going to work and you're gonna keep on repeating the same cycle.
ENFJ,"I'm a problem solver, but is hard when there are my own. I take care of my friends, is hard letting them do the same and because I'm a very private person (when it comes to my feelings) I realize that most of my friends don't know me and give me superficial advice."
ESTP,"Also, how can I make him feel appreciated?    I usually try to look listen at their tones, body movements and all that and this shoul at least give a sense on what the other person is feeling about. "
ISTP,Despite wanting to spend the night watching a Rambo movie marathon I've been convinced against my better judgement to go to a nightclub with a friend and his mates. 
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Prada   What do you recommend me to do?    Is it you the one who seems to carry the weight of the relationship? For example, does it have to be you the one to say to hang out, make all the plans? If so, I would say, become a bit more passive, let her seek you. If she's into you, no matter how reserved, she'll go out of her way to reach you. "
ESFP,"Originally Posted by Bugs   What do ESFPs think of ENTPs?    I think they are pretty adorable, in an annoying-kid, kind of way. Their Ne is very childlike to me but their nit-picky Ti hurts my head. It depends largely on the individual.

ENTP,a couple of ENTP mates and i want to know how to deal with them in certain things.
INFJ,Sometimes I only remember what day of the week it is based on my favorite webcomics' update schedules.
ISFJ,"Once again, sorry if this doesn't apply to people. I'm new to this and not exactly sure what is expected...    Hee hee...like hello317 said, you're worrying too much.   But there's no need to worry about worrying too much. "
ISFJ,Parents good. God as we know it is human construct. America is OK
ESFJ,"Hey all!  I just joined this forum and find it really interesting that there are so few of us ESFJ's that aren't on here.  I am an ESFJ, but have a lot of ""I"" in me as well, so maybe that's a discerning factor.  But, I really do enjoy learning about types and personalities and have joined the forums so I can learn how best to mother my children that are so different that I am.  If you have any questions for me, I'd love to answer :)"
ENTP,Originally Posted by Earthious   How to create more time?    stop giving a shit about deadlines or age and live in an infinite now
ISTJ,"Overly judgemental? You bet your ass. When I was down and out unemployed for three years, I never went for the alcohol/drugs/tobacco. I had self-respect."
ENFJ,":)    You obviously haven't met a truly pissed off ISTP before, have you? "
INFJ,"Really? WHY? Explain yourself. Rationally, and with data to support your conclusions."
ESFJ,My confession is that I actively smile at people and nod when they speak although I disagree with what they're saying in that moment. I just want to give them a good feeling and appreciation. Then I decide if I tell my opinion or if I let it go based on how much trust I have in our relationship. I know I fake it but it's more important to make them feel good than to tell everyone my opinion. 
ENFJ,I just need to quit getting so distracted by girls. Argh. I'm so frustrated with myself. It doesn't help that I just recently met an amazing new person.. So distracting.. And yet they always end up being a waste of my time and effort. I don't wanna waste my attention again. :/
ISFP,"In fact, I face it head on - if it is a problem, I try to sort things out, if it doesn't work, I go the extra mile to see if there is anything I could do to make things better. If there really is nothing I can do, I simply move on. Like, my brain just refuses to deal with it once it decides that everything possible has been tried and tested, and there simply is no way forward there. If you want to call that avoidance, you can, but I don't it's that. "

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Razvan   Well, you can change that routine if you want, it's in your power, all you have to do is start enjoying your life, if you have a problem that is stopping you from doing that, make a 2-3 year plan to solve it and take a step at a time in that direction, like baby steps till you get it right.  I don't know what is making you cry to maybe give you a specific advice and crying is not always a bad thing, in fact, it's a very good stress reliever, but I like to think that positive thinking always helps. Oh and I received this through email from my parents today : YouTube - The 90/10 Principle by Stephen R Covey , I thought it was funny because I wish they would have applied it with me too when I was growing up and did a lot of stupid things, instead of kicking my ass.  But it's a good rule that shows how positive thinking and not stressing yourself that much about certain things can be good to you.    Thanks!"
ISFJ,"You know you are an ISFJ when you realize you have been thanked in a post somewhere, and so you desperately search for that post.  If you find it, you are happy, but if not, it makes you sad a little."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Happy about Nothing.   Discrimination of the same kind I see on many of the forums is the same discrimination that has caused so many devastating atrocities in real life over the years. It's this group mentality thing, when I walk into an NT forum as an ENFJ. I am often met with hostility, just on the basis of my ENFJ-ness. "
INFP,"Okay, while that was a bunch of negative mumbo jumbo, I figured I would talk about some more positive things, despite being in a sad mood for the past five days. I do like my personality by and large. I like being kind and good. I like having complete faith in my values and morals. I like knowing that when I give my word to someone, I go out of my way to try to fulfill it. I love love, even if I don't get as much as I would like. I look forward to having children some day. I think being a dad would be very rewarding. I like seeing things in a different light from people around me, even other INFPs. I like that I can, at least I think I can, see problems from many perspectives. I had to learn this in my previous relationship to defuse tensions, expand ideas, etc. I really like my dreams, even though some of them can be a bit dark and depressing. I also like the rain, I know, a bit random. I like how my imagination takes off when reading or watching something I really enjoy. I feel as if I am in the reality that I am experienceing."
INFJ,"Teenagers... as a general rule, I like them.  Probably better than most adults. (Most likely because I have more in common with teenagers than adults, me thinks.)  I work with teenagers.  Sometimes, they make me laugh when I ought not to... (You know parents, like those moments when your kid does something & you know you should scold them and not laugh, but... you just can't help yourself?  The kids at work do that to me, sometimes.  Cheeky bastards!) "
ISFP,"For the record, I don't mind being mothered by my mother, usually. Just not by my older 13-year-old sister because she wants to pretend she's a grown-up with a baby. :P    It's more like what women would say about babies and how they say it except it's directed towards me that will tend to make me blush. I like to be complimented and adored as if i was a baby I guess because I usually wanna be a tough guy (which I'm not) and the compliments allow me to be vulnerable without risking too much of my masculinity If that makes any sense. Motherly or mothering is debatable for me. But I wouldn't like them to be concerned or controlling. Both are unsettling. I take an approach to life very differently than most people. I refuse to do things by most peoples' standards for many reasons and if they try to control my actions I'd probably leave them. "
ESTP,"I have a group of friends facing some relationship issues. INFP girl dating INFP guy. However, a year before she was going out with him, she ended an almost 2-year relationship with an ESTP. Now that she's got a new person, this ESTP guy isn't happy. During that year they weren't together, he tried pretty fucking hard to keep his ESFP friend from dating her, as well as others, so he's possibly annoyed that all his struggles were for nothing I suppose."
ISTP,"Originally Posted by Elicit   I freaking love my car. It's this archaic pick-up truck. The gas mileage is terrible, the back seats don't have headrests, and you can't park it close to anything or other things trap it in. But I love it. The other day I got into a fender bender. And by fender bender, I mean the tiny little compact has a huge dent in its trunk. My trunk has a tiny paint smear on its front bumper. The lady looked so pissed. That's what you get for cutting in front of a truck in your bitty machine.    ""With a little bit of luck I could find me a girl with a truck . . . "" - Tim McGraw"
ISTP,I have no desire to dress up for Halloween or any other time. I don't really want to put effort into being someone or something that isn't me. I don't really have fun when I'm fake on the outside.

ESTJ,"Originally Posted by ArmchairCommie   As an ISTJ I'm interested to know if ESTJs often blame their failures on others or on themselves? Also are you more likely to blame certain individuals of a group for failing, or the entire group itself?    Myself. If there's a group project, and we fail, there's always something I could've done better. That's not to say I don't blame other people in the group as well, but I tend to blame at least myself, maybe other people. And while I might know it wasn't my fault, it's a way of improving to the next time. "
INTJ,"Another question that goes along with what I'm asking is if you feel like you are being logical at all times, including during moments in which you are sarcastic/silly/angry?"
ISFP,Though I wish you had someone close to make you feel special. 5 people is actually a lot! Hope there's one quality friendship that'll make you feel like you had a genuine good time and are very appreciated. 
INFJ,I wouldn't think a pirate DD would be very trustworthy somehow.

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Mr Castelo   Why didn't you follow your own advice and ignored her post too, then? The answer is: people have the right to post whatever they want just as they have the right to be offended, don't tell people what to do. It is not rocket science!    I was not offended by her post and just wanted to explain that if you do not like something that someone says on the internet, then just ignore it."
ENFJ,The pain and the suffering I will cause with this rant will have repercussions I know. But the underlying need is something that will probably be lost because what I have really needed still hasn't been spelled out. 
ISTJ,"Well about 2 months ago my husband made a comment that she took wrong, and harbored ill feelings about until it finally exploded (or rather she exploded), this week. I have tried to reason with her that because she takes something one way, it doesn't mean it was intended to be how she perceives. After 2 days of complaining, I finally told her tonight that she was flat out wrong in her reaction. She said my husband needs to communicate better. I told her that his personality allows him to communicate in the way he does, and that instead of expecting him to change, that she needs to change her perception of him. She refuses to take any responsibility for her hurt feelings."

ISFJ,"I would say that if the person lives on the other side of the planet, they would have to be pretty extremely awesome for me to consider a romantic relationship, though. There is, after all, amazing people nearby as well. Unless there is some extreme chemistry I suspect it would be very hard to keep up the excitement and feelings when you never get to meet the person, so chances are I would grow tired of it. However, if it really, really felt right I would definitely try. :) I get along with a lot of people and am easily infatuated, but I don't fall in love so easily. When I actually do there's little that can stop me from trying."

ESTP,"Make it a point to challenge new people to Chess though. Especially if they only vaguely know the rules, because you can learn a ton about somebody by how they play, are they aggressive or defensive under pressure etc."
ISTJ,"And I say this in relation to myself. Sounds like common sense to others, but one lesson I've learned in the past several months is considering first whether the first words that might come out of my mouth during harsh times might bring down the other person's morality down with my own. If it's just a acquaintance or a not-so-close friend asking me how things are, I always answer good or great. If it's a close friend whom I can confide in, I only talk about my bad times when we're alone or on IM."
INTP,That philosophical question is all based on one's definition of sound.    How many definitions for sound are there?
ENFP,Having just a little bit of Fi show each conversation must be as teasing to the NFP's natural desires; just like having just a little bit of skin showing to the sexually repressed male of old would be delicious.
INFJ,Perhaps I am not yet able to be honest enough with myself.
INTP,"When I went out to eat with him, he sort of insisted that I drink alcohol. I do not like alcohol. But that's not what's important here. What's important is that the suspicious part of my mind thought he was trying to ""liquor me up"". After a while of taking sips and hating it, I asserted myself and politely refused his further requests to drink up. So, he took my drinks and enjoyed them himself. After that, I put on my smiley social persona and humored him for the rest of the dinner. Honestly, I did enjoy eating with him. Most of it felt like me just being really polite, though."

Oh and told me she was waiting at home on Friday, and let's not forget yesterday when he went out."

INTJ,"Originally Posted by aphelion   More as a friend. I don't want to ever get into a relationship with someone I'm not friends with, so I usually seek friendship with everyone I meet, even if I'm attracted to them. Although he may think I want a romance, since a lot of girls seem to like him that way... I guess that would make things awkward.    Would it make a difference if you told him you only wanted friendship. This way it would be making it clear for him, and maybe he wouldn't feel as awkward when speaking one on one."

ESTJ,They use the brute force method of getting through life.
ESFP,"Originally Posted by drummaster350   Sounds like an ESFP to me.  Don't feel  pressured to do anything you don't want to do or are not ready for.  Be  very honest and direct as that's how ESFP's are and they appreciate that  trait in others.  You might have to be the voice of reason in this  relationship.  Since ESFP's live in the moment it's very easy for them  to just go with their passion without giving much thought to any future  contingencies.    I think you're right that I may have to be the voice of reason. I  probed a little and he said he doesn't know much about the future stuff  and wants to move out of state but is a little bit scared of the  unknown, but a change seems to excite him. He doesn't have any solid  plans, and that scares me a bit if I were to be with him, but he's still  fairly young. It's difficult for me to make any decision. I love being  around him, and the thought of not seeing each other even as friends  breaks me. It's physically difficult for both of us to hold back. We're  both very affectionate in general, but it seems like he can't go a more than 10-30 seconds without being held or having some kind of physical contact. (Is  this normal even for an ESFP?) It's so cute, and it's mostly the only thing  I've known him to get impatient/irritable about. I'm dating someone else, and  unfortunately if I choose the other guy, he will not approve of so much  affection.  I don't know if there's much chance of it working out. I  feel not good enough for him. I don't even know why he's pursuing me.  He's got almost everything going for him (or it seems that way), and I  feel like such a mess. I don't know about the honesty thing. I'm pretty  sure I've caught him in a stupid like, and he mentioned he may lie if  the truth isn't comfortable at that point (or something). "
ENTP,"What are some things that I could do with a boat, a gorilla, some duct tape and a 40oz?"

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Zinerva   It makes perfect sense to me. I have experienced something similar, perhaps on a less intense scale but same frequency. I stopped sharing so much with various friends because 1) it didn't help much usually and 2) I think I knew all along that something needed to change in my life but I didn't know how or what, and I kept expecting others to tell me what it was. If you think it would help to go to a therapist, you could do that and see if anything is clearer. The state of mind you're in when you ask for help has a big impact on if you make a change or not as well. *shrug* I still struggle with knowing myself and understanding when to ask for advice and when to just seek out solutions on my own.

ISFP,"Wow, this is the darkest I have been in a while. Sorry if I depress anybody."
ENTJ,This is appropriate and relevant i think as this is an advice thread from ENTJs to others so therefore I'll give you this to think about.
ESFP,"Everything is ""fun"" for her, so it's going to be hard when I bring up the subject and become a ""downer"".  I really wish she'd spend some time alone with me so we could just talk. But she is so fucking social. That may never happen unless I make the one-on-one really attractive.  But I don't even think an invitation to Paris would help at this point.  She has let go of caring about her family or what anyone expects of her.  "

ENFP,"Originally Posted by devoid   What sorts of things attract you to a person the most? (appearance, personality, quirks, habits, etc.)    Depends what kind of attraction we're talking about. I can have complete mind-crushes on people where it's literally just their personality and quirks that attracts me to them, but I can also be really attracted to someone where it's just their appearance and presence that appeals to me, and I may find their personality uninteresting or just incompatible with mine. One is suitable for a serious relationship, the other for a fling. As for what qualities are most important in choosing a partner, definitely personality. The physical thing has to be there as well, but if I'm really drawn to someone's personality I tend to come to find them physically appealing even if I didn't initially - whereas the other way around (finding someone attractive and coming to like their personality as a result) has never happened to me.

She threw her head back laughing out loud when I told her about a few instances, where she was adorable (figured an example was the way to go with her)."

This is why I used an INFP and ENFP as examples in my initial post since they're more likely to lean on that Fi and run with it. Since I wanted to show a negative consequence of Fi misfiring I couldn't use a positive example (i.e. ""He jumped off a cliff and didn't break any bones"" isn't effective in conveying that jumping off a cliff is still a really bad idea)."
ISTP,"Originally Posted by cursive   selfies make me feel like a fucking dumbass    Same. I don't get all the narcissists who are constantly taking them.

ENFP,"1) Do you guys also sometimes feel a sudden need to meet new people (mainly oppposite sex :))?

And I had to make an hour long drive up there and back... so I was tired as all hell.  (I slept in my car during the slow bits in the afternoon.)  If I had a room in town... that would be awesome.  
INFJ,2) I don't know what she's doing at that time. I don't like to interrupt.
ISFP,"I just found it really difficult to accept this because i always thought of him as a respectable, outgoing, kind guy."
INTJ,"To answer the original question, animals seem to like me quite a bit.  Dogs like that I have nails so I can scratch them, and cats like that I wait for them to make the first move and always seem to come up to me.  Or maybe I'm just personifying them too much."
ESTP,"She's the stable one in the relationship; the anchor, while I'm the entertainer and doer (lol) and we both rarely ever get in a situation where we both want different things. Our analysis of situations and decision making is based primarily on logic and functionality but has just the right amount of impulsiveness to keep me continuously interested. That said, at my age (37) I'm pretty much a family man first and I'm done for now and my focus is on building a ""home"" in the proper sense. "

ISFJ,"Oh, no, I want to! I'm going to get the drinks, too--do you want anything?"
ENFP,"That's true. My INFP was a very wise person even though he was so hurt (or maybe because of it). Illogical ENTPs? Now that's something I don't want to see, though I have my ESFJ father to be illogical. Both my mother and brother and T types and they often faceplam at the things he says, even I do so. Sometimes he goes as far as not explaining his logic leaving us to think that he does things just because."

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by CorgiGirl   Just out of curiosity, if you sign a lease for a year, are you allowed to move out? What do leases entail? Can you break them?    Yeah it depends on your landlord.  Sometimes the landlord will go after the rest of the housemates if one housemate hasn't paid their rent.  Others will just hound the housemate.  Regardless, if it's a money issue, you guys should insist she find a replacement before she moves out.  Her name is on the lease so she is responsible for payments."

If people run away from everything theyll never have a chance to conquer it.    When I think about the lies I have told others it is over things like who I'm with or what I'm doing. You're right that it does not help and it is extremely disrespectful to the person I'm lying to. It creates mistrust and can cause animosity between people.

ENFP,"One evening, while talking about her new boyfriend, she went out saying that she's jealous of my female bestfriend. Also when she's saying something good about me she hesitates and slow down the speech."
ISFJ,"So basically, when you are angry at a friend, it's not a momentary anger, but a deep seated anger built up over years of compiling everything they have ever done to hurt you; and each incident builds on itself, until the emotion toward them is full of resentment at every slight, every time you've been ignored or yelled at. The emotion you are feeling at this latest infraction is old and creaky, because it is an emotion instilled in you long ago with that first infraction -- that first scratch at your heart, which has since become a deep, bleeding wound."

Putting myself in my lover's place, I would have a hard time dating me too. ;-)    I really do not think I encountered that with my INFJ.

The physical attraction you're talking about is only skin deep. What is more attractive and valued is a person's character and what they can do. Sometimes when I think about it, perhaps the only person I want to be attractive to is my SO, wherever she is out there. Cause despite how awesome it feels to be desired by everyone, being attractive to that one person and no one else and loving back the person the same way where no one else can is so much more profound.

He's very consistent and this allows me to plan for a future with him, and do the day-to-day stuff knowing that he won't throw a spanner in the works. Being able to plan and structure is very important to me, whereas it seems that for a lot of Feelers their emotions can dominate their lives."

ISFP,"I got a feeling of mindfulness the other day, while writing for matriculation exams. I was really anxious about everything at the first half, many kinds of thoughts (everything but the exam) had raced in my mind, so that I couldn't properly concentrate on the exam at hand. (Combined with my record of not taking exams seriously, no matter how important they were, and my general disability to concentrate well on exercises,) I had to really push myself to focus. So, after going through a mini thought vortex (I don't know how else to describe it), I had calmed down a bit. Granted, I still couldn't put my 100% mind into it, as it is hard for me to make my brain work efficiently at a task at any given time (my thoughts just drift naturally). "

There is no time to waste on unnecessary feelings that aren't productive and by the time I solve the problem, the emotional response fades away."

INTJ,"A lot of my questions had accidentally been covered by the presenter introducing the matinee, so my mind was so concentrated trying to come up with new ones, that when I went up there, I accidentally sat on the microphone that was left on the seat for me - and I didn't notice it at all until after I had finished asking my first question. I'm very happy I didn't accidentally fart, or people would have heard it over the loud speakers. Imagine that. But when I finally realized what I was sitting on, I just picked it up and showed the audience my missing microphone with a smile and a shrug. They laughed, and then the show continued. The TV-station filming the matinee edited out the microphone-incident from the documentary, as well as the one question that didn't turn out too well. So when I watched the episode with my family later that week, my performance seemed flawless on screen. Remember: they don't show these slightly embarrassing moments, because of what I mentioned earlier: the audience wants to see you succeed. If there is a toe-curling situation on stage, oftentimes the audience will feel what you are feeling, because they identify with you. In a lot of ways, a crowd is a lot nicer than talking to a single person. They almost never interrupt you, and they really listen to what you are saying - because if someone's on stage, then that someone MUST be worth listening to ;)"

Was half tempted to drive out with the camera to find them... but I'm so damned tired and I didn't sleep through anything... well bits of one thing that I watched that was just awful... and now I'm getting headachey because I'm so tired.  
ENTP,"You're right, stay far away of this girl! ;)    Purple!? How can it be!? Ok, if associated with some other color, as a secondary one, but, a full 'palette' of purple, and wool!!!? Remember me my grand mother clothes. :D"
ENFJ,I haven't woken up shivering and sweating at the same time ever :/ My heads still a little buzzed from.yesterday's migraine. I'm lost and alone. And it's fast becoming a point of ridicule. Tomorrow is a big day. Heh. Should I be sad or should I be happy? I'm both ... and neither at the same time. I'm stuck somewhere between wanting everything to knowing how detrimental wanting anything is to my own mental state. I want to ask for nothing. I want to expect nothing. And yet I know how impossible that is. I .. am .. so over-thinking tomorrow aren't .. I always do :/

She just got promoted recently. But that won't change her mind from quitting.    I used to work for INS (immigration) and I quit for this exact reason.

INTJ,"Or can we solve these dilemmas right here and now, for all mankind - but, especially, for yourselves?    Logic is what facts dictate, if there is lack of facts logic is hypothetical, therefore inconsequential. In cases where facts contradict themselves refining is needed, as subject is incomplete. Everything is knowable, all can be measured as long as instruments are accurate and functional. If something is unmeasurable it means observations are incorrect, and require refining. Perhaps a new approach."

ESFP,"Originally Posted by courageous_soul   Do ESFPs like to poke, prod, and rile people up to get them to open up?? This ESFP guy that I'm close to ALWAYS DOES THIS TO ME!     Nope, not generally. I get this a lot from ENTPs. I generally if I see something is up with a friend, I will ask them about it, with an invitation to decline if they're not comfortable. If they don't say anything I tell them that's okay, but if they need someone to talk to, they can approach me. And I leave it be and don't mention it again, unless they do."
ISTP,I consider it winning when I remember to wear underwear at all.
ENTP,ESFP: I think this concerns people you're unfamiliar with. 030
ISFJ,"I've noticed that we are far less likely to use profanity or vulgarity in our forum than other types. To the point where, any time I see somebody swearing or talking crudely about something like sex, I'm surprised and I automatically look over to see what personality type they are. Seven out of ten times it's another type who's dropped in on us. "
INFJ,-The feeling is both being out in the cold for so long that I feel the cold evaporating off of me and the feeling of warming up.
ISFP,"I can't really think of many battles where I had much ""victory"" or felt I had done a good job picking my battle. But I would say there are a lot more times when I wished someone had known something than that they hadn't, so as unskillful as I can be with words and despite always saying something really dumb and it coming out wrong, sometimes I just gotta be sure people get to see more than they would be capable of seeing alone, or the opportunity to if their stubborn hearts would just let them."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by soulsister11   I am sorry if this has been asked but back reading through over 100 pages to find out is not how I want to spend my time. How do you develop such good people skills? Compared to the other Te dominate and the Te auxiliaries, you seem to be more warm and engaging while still getting stuff done. I know a few ENTJs irl and they are engaging, popular, and approachable.    A smart ENTJ can make Te pose as Fe without being insincere to win people over and get shit done."

ESFP,I'll admit that the way how I ended the conversation is a tell-tale of Fi though.
INFJ,"One fascinating thing is that she would go quiet in a large group (not completely quiet like me, and I'm the one with the balls), talking about nothing remotely important but she has no problem sharing things about her life and self when she answers questions the professors ask in front of the whole class.

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by PurpleKitti   I can definitely see that as a legitimate problem, lol. I know I can kinda come off that way myself sometimes.

I've seen the traits you're talking about a bit more often in my mom (INFP) and my brother (ISFP), and yeah, it kind of wears my patience too sometimes. I think Fi can often incorrectly interpret Fe as conformity or ""hivemind"" and is in danger of self-erasure. I can tell you, badly-used Fe irritates the hell out of me, because it accuses me of being wrong on the basis of either ""majority rules"" or ""you're ruining other people's lives"", attempts to publicly shame me (lol, doesn't work; I'm sure my bemused expression doesn't help matters on their end), and *assumes* that I'm not using any logic in my approach to something. Not only that, I think that's more or less what Fi, if not balanced well by other functions, generally tends to see in Fe, even if it's used well and with good intentions. "

No. Not that, I can assure you ;P I'm very picky about who I'll allow in my inner circle. Maybe it's because as an ENFP I usually find myself fairly invested in everyone I meet, but also aware that I have to keep my distance to a certain extent because not everyone's going to be as focused on me in the same way as I feel like ENFPs tend to be toward others in general. So when someone is, and they truly notice me and care, I realize that's something special and want to investigate/foster/preserve it."

INTP,I've watched 6 seasons of Law and Order SVU in 2 weeks; I love this show way too much...
INTJ,I never thought of it as my job to proof the non-existence of god as well as Santa and the Easter Bunny. Surely it must be people claiming the existence of these that should provide proof. 
ENFP,"Do you think there's any chance it may be a fear of commitment? If so, you might be able to get help from a counselor."
INTJ,"INTJ forums are highly efficient, extremely well thought out, orderly and insightful. But it's boring to hang around people that think like you do all the time."
ISTP,"You also have to consider that a lot of the combination had to do with jazz and death metal being in near proximity to one another in Florida, in addition to the bands being in near proximity to one another. Now, I'm not saying it's not a good idea, it would just be very difficult to do without overdoing, and both have already been done. The influence of jazz in death metal has been there since the start, and a lot of current bands like Beyond Creation and Obscura have jazz influence, so why not do something that hasn't been done yet? Or push the boundaries somehow?"
ISFP,"In the video, he calls them ""the extras"" and uses the orbit analogy, with the sonder being the farthest out..."

Since you're only suppose to have 1 a day, my mom freaked out and called the poison center. They told her to just not give them to me for a day. That was not the only time she called the poison center for me, I also ate dog food once which freaked her out.    My uncle used to taste any new dog food before giving it to his dog."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Nyfiken   For once, I'm really annoyed at some ENFJs. Not anyone here, in another group. They started talking about sensors as a group and said things like ""they don't want to try anything new"", ""they are so resistant to change"", ""they don't interest me at all"". "
ISTP,"anyway, apparently your advice is welcome and appreciated. maybe it's just generational differences."
ENFJ,"I understand why you're here. This is my first post and being lonely in a new place is quite a challenge to overcome. #Confession I've been depressed for nearly a year now, and my insecurity is the reason why I haven't found the strength to go out and meet new people.    Aw! Hello sweetheart.  I do understand what you're talking about, yet I am not sure if I feel the exact same way. It is a little more like having tons of friends and still feeling lonely. Whatever.

ENTP,"I do this all the time. I just space out and imagine. It's hard to notice right when it happens, but I'll usually snap out of it wondering what I was just thinking about."
ENFJ,"I'm not unpopular. I've been told people find it easy to trust me and like me. They meet me, speak to me and find me compelling. But, I wish that I had at least one friend that wouldn't treat me differently to a different friend. At school, I might get an 'Hi, Alina!' but the same person would greet someone else with a squeal and a rib-crushing hug. Now, I'm not expecting that. I know that some people prefer other people's company to mine, but it's not fair to make the difference so hefty."

ENTJ,"If I were interested in dating you, if you're hot I'd let you be my arm bling to the Yacht Club parties or awards galas, but I'd brief you on STFU- let me do all the talking- just stand there and look pretty and smile and nod.  I'd wine & dine you, keep you happy every night, and have you waking up feeling like you're a million bucks. I'd string you along until the next NT chick comes into my life; one that I'm actually interested in being with that wouldn't tolerate my bullshit and that I'd have a better shot at a healthy relationship with.  Then your utility to me would be drained; I'd let you go by making you think it was something wrong with you, walk away, and never look back.  I'd get some gratification from watching your texts stream in every few months asking 'what happened between us?' 'Can we talk?'"

I totally get what you're saying. I was in the moment not really thinking about the past or future, and I think that's what felt good (plus I was wearing my favorite shirt ). I definitely don't get enough sleep, and I'm so busy lately it's hard to do those things I enjoy just for myself.

ENTJ,"As a manager, I had an INTJ as my assistant manager.  We got along great.  Usually came to similar conclusions. We'd mostly end up on the same page, but the road traveled was different.  I'd work with my office door open and welcomed interruptions, she prefered to really dig in and not interact too much with others because she found it distracting.  Her ideas were much better thought out to conclusion, and she would plan for more contingencies, but I was better able to ""roll with the punches"" when things went awry.  She'd get a bit more frustrated if things weren't working out, and sort of blame herself for ""not seeing it coming"" -  whereas I would get more fraustrated because it wasn't moving quickly enough.

INFP,"This has always filled me with a sense of shame; shame for who I am.

ENFP,"this could just be him trying to get his opinions out or making sure he is portrayed the right way.    I don't like silences, they feel awkward most the time between me and most people I know, so I try to keep it interesting. Most of the time, people cut me half way through and I can't get my thoughts out."
ENTP,"Or what would happen if you were in a room with interesting people talking too eachother but more or less ignore you?

ENFP,"Originally Posted by theredpanda   Do you guys see yourselves as normal or do you pride yourself on your uniqueness?    Haha, type 4 ENFPs will have a field day with this question . Yes...and no. When I was growing up, I went through a stage of believing everything about me was unique (perhaps due to my Ne developing? Not sure). Everything from my clothes, to my haircut, to the way I spoke (I used to purposely speak in odd ways because I thought it made me seem 'different' and 'cool'). Now not so much now haha. I've calmed down since then and realised that nothing about how I decided to style my hair, or what I wore that day was unique to the world, it had all been done before at some point. I used to despise trends (still dislike them, but not as much) and I didn't understand why people went with them. I would always do the opposite of the trend (for example, I used to get blonde highlights in my hair when I was about 12/13. Then every girl began doing it in my class, so I stopped and decided to try new things with my hair). Now though, although I have my own personal style and taste, others may share the same style and taste as me too, and that's okay lol. The only thing now I do believe is genuinely unique about me is my thought process, and my creative mind. I don't know anybody who thinks the same way as I do, and can view things in the same perspective as me. I don't know anybody who can come up with a million ideas, one right after the other, like me either. I take much pride in my imagination and thought process, and arrogantly believe my imagination is better than most hehe ."

Sometimes, I don't even realize that people get upset about it, because I don't view Facebook other social media sites as the barometer for our friendship.

ISFP,"I'm actually on the same boat, so I can sympathize quite well with you. I'm alright when friends introduce to their other friends, and trying to encounter new people to add to my very limited social circle, increasing my chances of meeting someone I might like, but I detest when they are pushy, and tell me I'd like this dude or that dude, and telling me I am too picky. Obviously, I too would like to be in a relationship, but I value my time with me, and if anyone wants to be included, they have to make me feel good.

Doing things exactly the same way becomes tedious and boring and can cause people to lose sight of the meaning of a particular tradition rather than reinforce its value. For me, there's an acknowledgment of how things have been done which can always be adjusted or shifted to accommodate current circumstance, to improve upon outdated or ineffective modalities, or even more importantly updated to align with current knowledge and proven fact."

You were already treading dangerous water by even complaining about something that not everyone would agree with. Not that you should keep your mouth shut just because of this, but you should have practically expected a debate to come out of it. But I have to ask, why are you complaining about it if it doesn't actually affect you? I understand if you want to sympathize, but you should know that this board is heavily American, so complaining about something that's happened in this country when it doesn't affect you comes off as condescending. I can get pretty angry at the lack of labor laws in China, but I wouldn't go on a board that's heavily Chinese and complain about it. I mean, I can only guess that they even have the same opinions as me. I have no idea what the view is over there of their own laws. Just like you're not here to know that the country is heavily divided at political lines and seem to be surprised that your statement met some resistance from those who do not agree with your liberal statements.

ENFJ,"If you really want a few tips (hehe, right me giving tips to an ENFJ about finding friends ), I don't know how people meet people in Canada, but here we meet them through other people and sharing common passions. Think what your greatest passions are then find online groups or real life meetings/workshops/whatever where people who share the same passion meet. Kuje I have some friends who love music, they started going to karaoke pubs and one thing to another they start talking with are people who sing and after a few weeks that can lead to a superficial friendship. It's probably easier to do this with more extroverted people you find there, but even with the introverts it works sometimes. If you have 3-4 passions and you do the same for all of them, you get a bunch of superficial relationships. From that, it takes time to find the ones with whom you could have something on a deeper level, you keep relations with all of them but superficial relationships give you a nice sensation only for a moment, the deep ones are a lot more fulfilling.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by goodthankyou   Alright so I've discovered that authenticity and integrity are two different things. First let me define integrity. It's simply doing what you say you'll do. And usually there's no conflict between authenticity and integrity until suddenly you're no longer in the mood to do what you say you'll do. An authentic person will go 'Screw it! I'll stay true to my feelings and I'll break my promise.' A person with integrity will go, 'I'll stick to my promise even though the situation has changed/ it costs me more now/ I'm really not into it anymore'. So integrity involves a certain kind of superficiality. Sometimes in order to be true to others, you have to be untrue to yourself.    Being a liar and a quitter isn't being true to myself. It's being selfish, and honestly, ""authenticity"" is often merely a cover for being selfish. You say something--you do it. You make a promise, you keep it. Don't run away and scream ""authenticity!"" That's just being a child. If you aren't a child, don't act like one.... and that just goes back to what I said in my first post. Integrity makes people uncomfortable. So be it."

INTP,"Surely many would argue adamantly that truth is individual, that it is ultimately meaningless if not for serving as a personal compass of reasoning and applying logic to one's perception of the external reality. What I mean to say is... Truth could be said to be a personal understanding that doesn't necessarily need to lie in accordance with anything else, perhaps because any other ""external truth"" could be found to be tainted by the external sources subjectivity (depending on what you're looking at). But really... Nothing could ever really be perceived objectively, because even if one does observe while consciously eschewing the application of their opinions and emotional reactions, our schema is ultimately a subjective understanding of the world, and if we can only understand the world through the lens of that schema, can the world ever be perceived objectively?"

Well, I don't think she's a bitch, maybe she doesn't realise how much it hurts you, have you told her that, have you communicated her feelings, have you asked her to stop telling you all those things because you are not ready for this kind of relationship right now and you still need to be protected in some way? Don't be afraid to communicate your feelings as long as you make it in a constructive positive way and don't put it in a hurtful way, it should be alright...Not all people are as intuitive as you are (or as I am) and not everybody considers everybody else's feelings. I had he same issue with an ex, I kind of cut her out because it was too hurtful for me to be in that situation, I couldn't be her friend after all that had happened. We still talk once or twice a year, for birthdays or holidays, but I wouldn't be able to have more. I just don't want to so I don't do it, I don't do it on purpose, but whenever she says something that hurts me, I just back away, find an excuse and close the conversation.

ISTJ,"Me...I don't know whether I'll end up marrying someone. I've come across plenty of cool girls, but never someone I could truly connect with and say to myself that I could live a lifetime with her with few complaints."
INTP,20 seconds later: I started thinking about what would happen if an INTP ran out of thoughts. Looks like I have my thoughts back.
INTJ,"Was wondering cause I've got quite a few ISTP friends, so I know what they're like, but I don't think I know any INTJ's - well one I think, and one who is possibly and INTP, not sure, but I'm not close to them."
INTJ,"Perhaps in the cosmos there is an entity that evolved on some of the first planets able to sustain life, and then it set out to eternal journey of discovery into universe and developed innovative technologies until the level of technology gave this species an ability to become godlike in the potency. But all seeing, almighty supernatural omniscient God who concerns over the faith and belief of mundane little humans on obscure puny planet in one spiral arm of one of the billions of galaxies I can not bring myself to even count as a improbable chance but absolutely impossible."
ISTP,I am simultaneously the unconditional lover and embarrassed observer.
ENFP,Aghhhh!!!! My whole world has been just turned upside down. *Cries* why?.??? 
ISFP,"And as an aside, there are people here who don't like MBTI, cognitive functions, etc. who prefer the Big Five, or the dichotomies in MBTI. IMO, though, Keirsey is a much better and complete system than dichotomies or Big Five. He really nailed down the four temperaments, and leaves wide latitude for individuals through the four roles within each temperament. His book is really and honestly good. The more I read it, the more I appreciate what he did with that book."
ENTP,"5. Snark about how your life is a good comparision to your snark, as fulfilling as eating a single bean."
ISFJ,Could you enlighten me as to what triggers you to suddenly being like that?

ENFP,"!= Constructive criticism.    What equals ""!""? I believe I provided a fact why it was bullshit so it  was constructive criticism. And now you use a quote and rip it out of  context. I have no idea where you're going with this and what your intentions are."
ISFJ,"5) When you spend months planning someone's gift, and spend hours and hours and days on the actual gift, because you want it to be perfect, and you want them to really know how much you love them.

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Red Mange   where can one expect to find ESFJs IRL? with their families? friends? i have heard nothing but good things and i want to meet one    I am an ESFJ and I would say anything that is out of the mainstream on the Internet would not be the place to find ESFJs. Most of us are very 'mainstream' in life. I use Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram like crazy because my friends and connections in real life can be found there. But when it comes to websites where there is less concern with our loved ones, we are less likely to be found. "
INTJ,"ESFJ - The Caregivers  0.69% 162PersonalityCafe - e-steki Profile Statistics    Funny that, since the type I probably come across most in real life among family and general people is ESFJ.

Or maybe it's very ISTJ of me that I no longer have that emotion after the fact. But I have no idea if I'm in the right or in the wrong. I just am getting a little tired of  the kitchen being a free for all. While this roommate was still studying abroad, we didn't use each other's mugs (which only left the matching dishes), didn't share anything that wasn't verbally negotiated, and cleaned up after ourselves. We were pretty irresponsible as it took forever for someone to do the dishes, which has improved. I'm happy about that. But other than that, the kitchen usually looks like a disaster zone. And only one person actually cooks so.. yeah. I mean, I""m not the perfect roommate when it comes to cleansilness, my book from tuesday night is still in the living room and some of my game controllers are strewed around but those don't get stuck on like food. Nor do those things take long to clean up or spread germs. "

Now you enter the corner. Your head tilts into the curve as if on a motorcycle following the line of the yellow. Your hands move the wheel incrementally to clip the apex as your foot is fluctuating the gas. You feel through your spine the torque in the rear wheels as the car tucks into the corner from more power being released by your right foot. You feel the grip reaching its edge as you give more and more gas and unwinde the wheel. The gs pulling you and the car away. The power pushing you in tighter. Then you are on the straight.

He doesn't listen, then he starts making smartass remarks, then I lose my temper and my whole day is ruined by this individual.  He is so bloody stubborn that half the time he won't allow you to explain things to him because he thinks he knows it all.  I actually am at the end my tether and don't know how the hell to motivate him.    I can't not smile at this.  Reminds me of my experiences with my ESFJ mom. You have a better edge though due to your intuitiveness. Use humour, taunt him, beat him at his own game with his smartass remarks. (I would be able to give you some hints if I knew what the remarks are). Also getting to a solution of a problem is a great motivator, if he thinks he knows it all, give him a set of problems that he doesn't know how to solve, then help him solve them. We are very independent so we have to eralise we need your help before we can accept it. Be flexible about the ""not listening"" part, we are day dreamers, we can focus really well on things we really enjoy, maths is probably not amongst our favourite (though I preferred it to a lot of subjects). Try to make it as creative and interesting as possible, that will make us listen more carefully. Like, instead of finding out which of 2 trains goes faster between 2 cities both having different speeds and having different times, make it like...if Batman and Superman were running in a speed race. I doubt there is an INFP who does not love superheroes.  That will definitely get him to listen. Or if Superman had to save the world from a virus bomb and the key to deactivate it was caputred in this ecuation : x*x-2X+1=0, can you help Superman save the world?  Or let's say he is learning Pitagora's theory, talk about how greeks lived in that day, build a connection between him and Pitagora, make it sound as much fun and interesting as possible and make it look like it's not a routine thing.

Personally I should have read like 15 books this summer, guess what happened? Well teacher likely forgot to mention, that we should read those. My memory is rather good, so I'm pretty sure she didn't. We have a law to not assign students to do work on holidays. So I'm lawful bastard. I know, that I should read all that stuff, but I just can't even start doing that. I'm really pathetic human being. It sucks, it doesn't feel good, I'm lost, yet mental block of reading is present, after all I should just read, but my mind is like ""one doesn't simply read books"". I can only bear frustration, nothing more. It's all fucked up.3) How can anyone make this more comfortable for you, or help you? Probably not much, but most of time I wouldn't mind friendly chatter or some random activity. I think it should help a bit. Maybe even being social may be helpful. Just something do that , that is perceived to be more valuable, than just doing that stresses me. It's really hard to say exact things. Also I'm somewhat bad at understanding my own feelings. "

You don't see her caring so much about rules as much as, well, it's her job to enforce them, but not part of her character so much.

Conversely, the first few times I hug someone(as it is something that does require a significant degree of attachment to get me to do) I am likely to do an around the neck/shoulders thing because it's on a level less intimate and I am taller than most everyone I hug (because most of the people I hug are women, not because I'm trying to put the moves on them or anything but because I get on much better with women and as such all but one of my friends are women, who tend to be shorter and so the neck hug is easier for me to do)."

He even sobbed when I suggested breaking up saying its not what he wants. But its all changed so distracicly from the man who would do anything for me 6 months ago, to this new version who seems very distant. "

But I'm not a patient person and this ""hot and cold"" game has been going on for a bit too long for me. I would prefer to know where we're heading and if she's interested or not. She already told me she was ""able"" (as in not socially exhausted as much) to hang out with me more often than with anyone else. I already dated an introvert before so I know that means much but even the ""moves"" that she has been making recently are too subtle for me. I have trouble understanding how she means it. I mean, most of my friends are extroverts and they do way ""more"" in friendly way than she does. So I have trouble figuring her out.    Personally, I really love hanging out with people I like and take them to some cool place I found out, do some activity together... (though I admit, I'm really not a big planner). I only find it draining if we're too many or it's people I don't know. So I'm not sure either where she's coming with the whole ""able"" to hang out more. I also know that I'm not that comfortable hanging out with 1 person, I much prefer smaller groups of 3 to 5 people (myself included). "

When dealing with someone stoic or verbally with someone who goes quiet it can make me question how they are feeling so i usually ask. ""everything ok?"" ""are you mad?"" to make sure im not offending them in some way.  I think all ISFJs want to see people around them content.    So if you meet an INTJ who is a bit stoic and you end up asking them if everything is okay and they say something like, ""yes, everything is fine.  I'm enjoying myself, I'm just a bit stoic.""  - would that be okay for future occasions or would their stoicism continually bother you?"

ESTP,"I'm very reluctant to address this, because during my early teen years I had seizure after seizure.  Once at school around the 8th grade I woke up in an ambulance after having one.  But somethings stick out.  I really have a hard time being grateful for what I have,because that's a reflection.  And certain reflections like that are harder for me, even at 38.  So, I would practice instilling in her the theme of gratitude.  Also, I'm basically here on this board, because it was only when I got high did I see the bigger picture of how my actions have consequences.  I keep learning this, my favorite quote about this is from Bob Dylan on not being able to arrive where you think you're at.  That is so true.   I'm always becoming aware to what the consequences of things are.  I suspect this person has a hard time envisioning consequences.  This is a very misunderstood area, because I think at least with me, people were like doesn't he know he's going to get into trouble.  And I really don't.  I like my chances.  I always am confident of my chances, even when they are not in my favor.  So I think that needs to be drilled in, but do it in a polite way.  Don't say ""you are wrong and you just have to follow me"", you need to be there as a guide.  Mix that in with gratitude.   This advise is just for the little sister.  But on that note.  I have an ESTJ dad, and we get a long fine.  So, I think the boyfriend and the sister, have potential.  I do think there will be conflicts,but I see more agreement than disagreement.

ENFJ,"You want to find people who accept you, you should just be yourself, do things that you like and find people with similar interests or who are alike. I really sucked at socialising in highschool, so I can't give you an advice about that, I had friends with whom I went out, played sports (because I love sports), went to see a movie from time to time, focus on having a circle of friends who can truly appreciate you and accept you for who you are, it will make it a lot easier to get support when something like this happens, but it also enriches your life. You will never be lonely. PC is also a good place tofind people who can relate, to learn, to have fun, you'll definitely find many people who will accept you hereand if such people exist here,they definitely exist out there too. "
ISFP,"And don't get me wrong, I'm very happy for my Dad! But for a good chunk of my life, I wondered how happy he was being married to my mom. My dad is very quiet and dutiful, exactly the type of person who might keep himself miserable for the benefit of others, and my mom truly would have been lost without my Dad. I feared the prospect of my Dad dying first because of how devastated Mom would be. But since Mom's death, my Dad has seemed like a new, and oddly, happier man. He talks a lot more and seems to have more energy and enthusiasm, but maybe he just doesn't want anyone to worry about him? I relate to this behavior quite strongly....I could have serious life problems but still put on a good show so nobody feels obligated to take care of me. Perhaps I have more Fe than I think..."

Admittedly work is fun for her, but she admits it's not the only kind of fun she wants to have, and it is stressful a lot of the time. So I told her, if you realise all that why don't you do something about it? She says she's addicted to her work. And studying. She has to be the good girl, do things others expect of her, not disappoint anyone, not create a ripple in the water. She shoulders responsibilities and problems that have literally absolutely nothing to do with her. She gets attached to people in a way that isn't healthy."

ESFJ,"Coming from an ESFJ, I had a hard time saying no for the longest time until recently because of my relationship with an ex who was ISTP. I learned a lot from him and he taught me what I needed for myself and deserved in a relationship, which meant that I definitely needed to date an N person haha. I used to say ""Maybe"" as a way to avoid conflict of saying no and feeling bad. It's definitely something where we ESFJs need to work on our inferior Ti to think about what we want and what is and isnt appropriate in a situation. Funny story, I recently began using my Ti more and my INTJ and INTP friends were saying how if I relied on it too much I'd start to act like an INTP lol. I began to do that and they would yell at me and tell me to stop being that way, which is why I was so intrigued with your responses. They felt relatable in a way, but I see that I have to use my Ti in moderation to be balanced enough with my Fe dom. The ESFJ you were talking to probably was just unaware and more unhealthy if anything. Not all ESFJs are that way, and just need a motive to change their perspective so long as you word it in a way that we can understand. In my experience I found dating people is where I made my biggest changes and growth in life. It's interesting to see how you do it differently because it gives me a different perspective in the approach. It makes me want to learn more from you. :)"

My educational background is in sociology and politics, originally I was looking at research, but got frustrated with the bureaucracy and inability to instigate change, so I went back to study law. Again, incremental change is possible, but even large victories can be overridden by acts of parliament. So the only way to truly effect lasting change and have the most control is by being a policy-maker. Whenever I hit a ceiling, I butt my head against it, questioning authority and trying to force a change in order for me to achieve my own ends. I am never content to be told what to do, so I'm learning the language of power, so that I might eventually wield it (although the question will be in the private or public sphere as I am also reasonably achieved in business).

ISFP,"Remember that 'nice' means different things to different people. Some people do nice things to other people, some people are just 'nice' to other people. Why do you do nice things to people? Is it so that others will do nice things to you, or is it to be more liked? I'd think the latter would be the answer for a Fe-dom or aux, while the former for a Fe-tertiary or inferior. Note that these days, it is considered ''assholish'' enough to do nice things to people in return for nice things from them. An example: ''I paid for your meal (without your consent), so you have to give me a blowjob now''. Naturally ''nice'' people do nice things to others without expecting anything back. That is how mainly dominant Fe people act. But since ISTP's have inferior Fe, and dominant Ti, it is hard to reverse the positions for them, so I guess it's not natural for them, so they rely on doing nice things instead of being nice. I'd say, again, don't overthink it. I hope this made sense though. "

There is an idea and/or inspiration, then I imagine how the 'creation' should be in 'reality', then I think out some sort of plan for its creation, and then I get to work. Anything can be turned into an art form: how you eat, how you type, how you breath, etc...

I know a few members have chosen to label themselves gender-neutral, and pansexual, which makes me wonder how common it is, and how accepted these choices would be for other INTJs.

ISFP,"To me, having sample code that is clean and easy to figure out is key. There is, sadly, a lot of sloppy coding out there. IMO, if one can't figure out what someone else did rather quickly--if you can't see the logic and the flow, then that is sloppy coding--brute-force coding, if you will. (one reason why so many web pages take so long to load). There's a really good, dead-simple boilerplate out there, called Skeleton (Skeleton: Responsive CSS Boilerplate). Play with that until you learn how it all works, then find other snippets, and keep adding. When you are ready, try adding CSS to it--but don't do your own at first, try modifying good CSS, and see how things change. Honestly, I've never really been able to totally grasp CSS simply by doing it. It seems that the spec includes things like variables or something, and I would need to do some reading and learning, but I don't have the time these days, nor the inclination. That said, I've been using Adobe Muse for my newest web site, and I'm rather unhappy with it. It's not the fastest code, even if it is easy to create a page. I am seriously considering moving to Skeleton to create it. And I'll probably have to delve into CSS if I do... and there will be my motivation. ;-) "

The other night he literally told me he was disappointed cuz I'm not obnoxious. That the girl he remembered dating before was fun and ""obnoxious."" The last time he dated me I was 15!!! WTF? Did he honestly think I wouldn't grow up. I'm sad to report that I think our problem is I was hoping he'd grown up into an adult by age 30 and he was hoping I didn't grow up and was the same."
ISFP,"Had a great time at my mother's wedding reception yesterday. I have many thoughts right now -- all positive.

ISTJ,"I really shouldn't be ranting anymore, but I really felt like finishing it up with something pleasant, that is, a mutual friend agreeing with me. It makes me feel better. Especially since this friend is bad at taking sides when he knows both. I suppose it might be because she is calling him a jerk for doing things that he's not doing.    Wow, I was thinking that must be really hard for one roommate to not be on the same page with the importance of certain dishes going in certain places. How about you guys establish clear definate solid rules about where things go, but at the same time you have to recognize its hard for her to really value this level of organization. I don't know, I guess its easier when its someone you can communicate well with in the first place. Did we already cover this."

ISFP,"Originally Posted by lunaticrabbits   Hmm. Sometimes deep discussions are nice, but I feel like there's only a limited amount of those deep/abstract topics I can talk about. Also when talking, I mostly think about what I can surely know is true, so theorizing might be a little difficult. I would be fine talking about my own moral views, but the subject of morality itself... I don't know, it sounds far fetched but it could be possible, even if only a little. "
INFJ,"Originally Posted by Aizar   Forever seeing things in a different perspective from others...when it's a positive reflection I see, it's a blessing and inspiration to others.

ENFP,"Originally Posted by Pyogenes   Does speaking the phrase ""I love you"" carry a lot of significance? Or is it the connection that matters more, and the verbalization is secondary to what is already understood intuitively?"
ESFP,"You see, from what I've gathered, Fi doms have fluctuating self esteem, needing a lot of information to make them feel confident again, Ti-Ne is information heavy because it second guesses itself and also  needs enormous amounts of confirmation, not so much an issue of self esteem, rather a general distrust towards information itself, and Se/Ti generally doesn't like to commit long enough to these types of conversations unless it excites them for some reason. Especially Ti-Se doesn't seem to like dealing with the same people over and over again."

ESTJ,"I hated my kindergarden because the people were boring and never let me do what I wanted. The girls weren't very nice although I had a few female friends and I just liked to play with some of the boys. Also, I frequently threw tantrums at that age because I was indecisive and someone forced me to decide. During elementary school, I had two very good friends and also got along with the rest of the class. Our school was a bit alternative and we were able to do whatever we wanted whenever we wanted as long as we finished everything until the end of the day."
ENFP,"I know you're trying to tell me something but I don't want to jump to conclusions and I am not sure where you wanna go with all this. Why aren't you straight with me?

I called you out on your ""bullshit"", you change the topic (me being an NTP) and now you're  changing the topic again. I would like to have a conversation with you, but I can't if you are not straight with me. So please, be straightforward do you want to talk about _Ne-Fi and Ne-Ti or do you want more evidence why your post was incorrect?"
ENFP,"I got nothing good. Do you guys (and girls) put much thought into how you dress/look? I doubt specific fashion choices are type related, but the amount of consideration you give it could be.

Hey thanks for the reply! I can see what you're saying for sure, however the Ne may not seem super visible all the time but within how it works I do find myself going and branching of ideas/concepts in more and more naturally than the way I'm seeing Se as taking it whats actually there and not really trying to read any further into it. I'll typically like the main point or description of something to be given so then I can branch it out and see all the directions it can go, be it a drawing /painting I'm working on to remember trying to help me see connections from what I do more often than not initially and naturally more at ease with doing, like say with understanding what functions I use. When I generate all the possibilities of something from a specific point, I will think in many different directions and try to see how many are of that same pattern/ect in accordance to what the main point was. That is a little harder for me to do, but generating all the possibilities and branching out from idea's/theories always happens whether I'm intending for it to or not sometimes causing me to go 'off-topic' or suggesting something that doesn't make any sense. I find myself doing that without realizing it. From what the 'core base of Ne' does as function is branch out, and the 'core of Se' taking in concrete information. "

How do you react when girl takes initiative or inspirates changes for the couple (she is ""puller"", not ""pusher"") in the form of loose propositions, but not forcing to anything (I really praise independence). Do you feel too much limited and shun such relationships?    I like when we can switch depending on the situation in complete complementation of each other."

ENFP,"Or if it's something the other care deeply (the woman spent hours at the beauty salon,  hundreds of dollars,  comes home all happy showing her hair... will you dare to say it sucks, you hate and hide behind ""I'm just being honest"" ... sorry, you're an idiot. "
ISFP,"Another thing is, I'm noticing more and more lately how extremely gawky I am. Nowadays I can't even have a conversation without feeling like I'm trying too hard. I don't want to go back on my anxiety pills but I fear that, if I don't, I'll end up trying to medicate with alcohol. When I'm intoxicated, I might still sound like the idiot I fear I am, but I just don't care."
ISTJ,Originally Posted by Sela   I don't care for musicals.          Originally Posted by Qadosh   Musicals are not cool.  
INFJ,"For instance, we burn carbohydrates, meaning molecules that contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and use them with the oxygen we inhale in order to produce the water and carbon dioxide we exhale, and the energy we use to live."
ENTJ,"I recharge by exercising. I put on my headphones and just go- it helps me think and clears my head. I don't recharge by being around people, because I'm always planning in social situations. I can get recharged by a good group conversation, and I'll find myself drawn to certain groups, but I can also get overloaded and need alone time."
ISFJ,"@Cassieopeia  Tbh, yes, I was offended. Because I think it's wrong to say that I don't want to be an ISFJ. In fact, I admire ISFJs so I'm okay with being one. But the way she put it made it seem like I think being an ISFJ is a bad thing but yes, I agree with her that I should be more honest to myself though. I do feel more like an ISFJ after reading articles about them but some of the traits doesn't define me. Does that happen? And, I guess I don't have to depend much on enneagrams then. "
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by niss   I agree with the first statement. The second statement will hurt you, not them.    Oh, that was just a way of pretty much saying ""I'll smile, shake hands, and introduce myself. I'll even be polite and give birthday girl her due on her own special day even if I'm not her #1 fan. But I won't try to be her friend if doing so would require that I keep that mask on for long periods of time."""
ISTP,"Yesss, I honestly wonder if people even look at their eyebrows.  I don't expect men to have chola brows but some maintenance is nice. "
ESTP,"As an ESTP, you've decided you need time to be single, heal a broken heart, etc.. and you've committed yourself to a phase of life in which you're only wanting casual relationships for a couple of years, but then  you meet someone extraordinary in the process. Someone you have amazing chemistry with. That you learn from. Have an absolute blast with. What happens then?  And how does this come across to the world?"
ESTP,"Originally Posted by shazam   my letter is broken on my laptop     You should start requesting payment for the answer to that question, then go buy a new one : )"
ISTP,Boss: you'd better bring your Speedo!And now I can't get that image out of my head. Yikes.    and now I wanna see this guy.
ESTJ,"The only type of ""fun"" they approve of is to hang out with friends. "
ENFP,"Originally Posted by ai.tran.75   Starryhawaii -has any of you tried to trade forex or trade market or stock markets? Are you any good at it, or at least see potential in that area (objectively) if you had decided to keep on trying ? "
ESTJ,"If you read the discussion about socialism, who would you agree more with, herkapernikis and SilverFalcon or TheSonderer. Why?"
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Nimbus   So, ENTPs, does the Christian God have balls?    Yes and he is circumscied too. In fact every year we celebrate and commemorate the chopping down of his dick by eating some cake."
ISFP,"ISFPs need ample opportunities to use their creativity, and we tune out when there are too many rules about how we have to do it. We also need quiet time to recover our energy, so building that into the day -- time for kids to read or quietly work alone on projects would give them a chance to recharge a bit for the next lesson."
ENTJ,Can you help me paint with a more specific brush? I love specifics. I also love answers. 
ESTJ,"I can often ""sense"" if something is different than how it has been before. It's not always something I can put my finger on, but I can see that something is different. "
ESFP,"I need to be better though, I need drive, passion, ambition! The primary reason why I used to fail in my endeavours was because I had too many of it, too much ambition and too much pride. Now I have little to none, and I need to find a balance.    I still fail to see why you are ENTJ. Nothing at all shows that. All your attempts of explaining yourself throught typologies seem so weak. Like it would all fall apart if your type isn't ENTJ.       Originally Posted by Krokottas   This almost two decades long forced inertia has made me way too comfortable being lazy.

ESFJ,"You can message one of the mods for the ESFJ section and ask them to sticky it. Or mention one of them in the thread and request it. To find the list of mods for this section, go to ESFJ Forum - The Caregivers scroll down to the end where the mods are listed."
INFJ,"Me:  No. Not necessarily... but I'd like the ones I do sign to make some fucking sense.  Signing this log makes it look like I signed off that I knew all these keys were turned in... when in fact, most of them will be turned in after I leave.  That makes no fucking sense to me. "
ESTP,The face that we are able to ignore rules in way for our goal doesn't mean that we like this extra obstacles.    Hmm... 
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Cheeta   Me? Effort? Did you see effort somewhere? And feel? Uh: ""no-thing""    The fact that you are bothering to reply to my messages display effort. As I no longer wish to see the pitiable state of your comments, I will cease to give replies that are clearly destroying your pride. Good day sir."
INTP,If America is fucked does that mean that the world is fucked? Or do chances of not being fucked increase substantially as the picture gets bigger? I need data! Not sure where to get it however.
ESTP,"Again, just my experience. It may have less to do with personality type and more to personal aspirations."
ISTJ,"Then again, I could just be overreacting, hence my decision to use the words ""wondering."" I truly do hope I am. Then again, it's my observation that you have women who get hyperactive over even instances where gender discrimination wouldn't even be remotely present no matter how many times you re-examined the facts of certain incidents. Then you have women who don't seem to care about the way they're objectified in the media; in fact, some seem to enjoy it. I don't consider myself a male feminist, but I think it's the obligation of any civilized individual to question the beliefs and narratives of the society of the society he or she inhabits. "
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by cake   When would you start calling somebody ""babe"" ""hun"" ""sweetie"" or ""cutie""?    Whenever it works for you and you're comfortable enough. Most ENTJs do not use terms of endearment."
INFJ,"Assassination attempt on one of our more sleazy politicians, from a couple of days ago. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.*sigh* That's Bulgaria for you.    What the heck! o_O His gun didn't fire?"
ENTJ,"When I date, I don't think of the 'end goal' yet, not about him being my life partner, getting married and having kids."
ISTJ,"@zeth006  is having an internal battle.  He wants to go, but he doesn't want to go, but he wants to go, but he doesn't...but he does...but he doesn't.  So he can't decide.  I do the same thing."
ENFJ,"I'm also scared for all of my subjects this term. I decided to not give a damn about it because I was so put off of studying with what I got the previous term. I didn't get Dean's Lister that term because of one subject and it really threw my record away, so I just didn't bother with this term anymore."
ESFP,"As for myself, I'm pretty tolerant of my actions. I know they're done with good intentions, so I can't stay mad at myself for too long ^_^"
ISFJ,"In Jung's theory the suppressed function sometimes can ""hijack"" the main function to such a degree that the person affected by it looks as though he has been possessed by some sort of demon because he did things that were opposite in nature to his usual self. "
ISTP,"Upon seeing her, I had the weirdest impulse to hug her."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by dalsgaard   I just found ""The War of the Worlds"" in the bottom of an old box (I knew I had it somewhere). Time to read :P    READ IT! READ IT NOW! (different author but still)"
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by MBTI Enthusiast    Just so you know, it appears that you are asking niss what turns him on.    That's just an added bonus ;)"
ISFP,"I live in a house with 3 other guys and we frequently have friends over and a party every or every other weekend. I could have a very fulfilling social life without leaving my house. She often implied I should just hang out with my friends, which I didn't care to do because I saw them all freaking day. I wanted to see her, I know now she wanted alone time to recharge or time with friends I wasn't mutual friends with. "
INTP,I picture the level...what is it...Oxford Circus? every time I see those words.
ESTP,Originally Posted by Jawz   I carved out my own group of friends based around shared interests and hobbies. Basically I was the dude who brought the group together. Kinda king of my own little domain. 
INTJ,"I find occultism interesting sometimes, and I like the ideas that it often generates. This was one of those ideas. I actually had no idea it was the name of a character from Harry Potter. I derived my name from books I've read about the occult.

ISTJ,"I am rather angry at the fact that it seems some moronic, grossly ill-informed, gratuitously simplistic Tea Party Republicans have sufficient numbers in the US Congress to be able to influence the political process to such an extent that they have helped not only to agitate an already anxious global economy but also expedite the economic and geo-political decline of the US. It appalls me how some narrow-minded, largely economically illiterate ... people can undermine, through sheer stupidity, the investments of billions of other people!"
ENFP,"Originally Posted by StarryHawaii   Looks sort of extroverted to me, probably a sentinel. "
ESTJ,10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others.          Originally Posted by Charlie   absolutely.  I just have yet to meet an ESTJ who doesn't fit the stereotypes.
ISTP,"Oh, and I haven't even started on the kind of work it is. I am basically a till lackey. I work on the till all day and learn nothing. Two hours or so before I go home, the shop empties and I have absolutely fuck all to do. It's painfully boring."
INTP,Originally Posted by crucio   Did they? Link me :O I've never seen that before    I just searched it & it's not doing that anymore. Hmm... that's weird because it did that before(had what I searched in the tag).
ENTJ,"The old man is an ENTJ and for as long as I've know he has been the biggest tight ass with his money.. Although he's an extremely successful man, he's let money control him.. For an example of why I call him a tight ass is because he'd remember every cent I owe him and would ask for his 5 cents back if he lent it to me. When he travels abroad with the old lady he'd purchase the cheapest tickets which meant that he and my mum weren't sitting together for the whole flight including the return flight. I could go on, but hopefully you're catching the drift. "
ISTP,"I only feel that way when people, or should I say family, go away from me but I have no problem when I'm leaving. I can be on the other side of the world in Asia for months at a time or in Europe for an extended period of time by myself, but I won't feel lonely. "
ISFJ,"Her: I didn't see Juno with you, [boyfriend] and I saw that on our first date."
ISTJ,"Dang it. I don't have too many formal clothes. I may need to go out and buy some next weekend as my work is sending me to a judge's court room to do his paperwork and schmooze with him tomorrow. I'll be spending tomorrow morning scrounging for clothes. Until then, I'm going to assume for now that lunch is on them (yay?). "
INFJ,"I hope today is smooth, and conflict free, and that the call I've to make tracking down a missing check is fruitful..."
ESTP,Originally Posted by monemi   Oh good. Carry on then. 
ENFJ,"I've always been the charming kid that everybody loves ... i've always been the cute foreign kid in a predominantly Caucasian environment that every other girl thought was cute, and funny and endearing, and hot, and dateable, but unavailable because he was too busy swooning over someone he couldn't get. I attract them .. even when I don't want .. I really never felt like actually running after any relationship .. it just always happened. I never pursued friendships .. they just happened. "
ISFP,"Any time I open my mouth I just cause tons of trouble.  I share my opinions and my ideas and most people don't take me serious, or they think I'm an idiot, or they think I'm insane, etc.  Am I that socially inept that I cannot hold a simple conversation with someone without making an ass of myself?  How does everyone else do it?  Should I get interested in sports or reality shows, or Dr. Who so that I actually have something I can talk about without being so self concious?  Even then if I do find something cool and share it with some friends, they ignore it.  They won't really give it a chance until someone more ""normal"" says that this thing is cool.      "
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Prada   Who have you dated more often, introverts or extroverts? I'm asking this because while I'm way more attracted to extroverts, I seem to have real relationships more with introverts so I was wondering if this is common.    We batted this around before you joined up.  (Last year, maybe? it's been a while)  I think the question was directed to ENTJ women - I don't remember the men responding ..."
ENFJ,"The quiet before the storm. I love it. A clean house, no roommates, and the company of a sleeping puppy and a silly cat before the hustle and bussel of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day."
ESTJ,Just some common stuff I saw between them.  Possibly just truths though.
ENFJ,"I really like to share random shit with people like, ""omgz. i did this and this and saw this last weekend."" Then there are things I probably should be proud of where I am just like... ""Eh. I'm not going to tell anyone that, cause who really cares."""
INFP,I'm getting kind of worried about my course. It's gonna be so expensive. And I'm barely gonna be able to cover my travel costs. Let alone have much money to spare. But It's only really the first year that's gonna be a struggle. After that it wont be as bad. And it's worth it if I get to do Graphic Design for a living for the next 40 years.
ENTJ,Maintain employment - no need to work if there's enough $
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by anonymousL   @stephiphi Uh, no. This is where you're wrong. In what way do you think that I don't want to be an ISFJ? It's not that I don't want to be an ISFJ but it's the fact that almost every test I did classified me as an INTP. That's what making me confused. This is all new to me, thinking that I was an INTP all along and then all of a sudden, BAM, people tell me I'm actually an ISFJ. I'm just trying to make sure so that I won't mistaken myself as an INTP/ISFP in the future. Is that wrong?    You seem a bit offended which points more to Feeler to me. I probably would have responded in a similar manner, even though I know she was just being honest and totally not in the wrong."
ISFP,I don't do well with longterm. I find focusing on what is important to me and exploring my creativity are what truly makes me feel alive.
INTP,"On a different note, I love being the dungeon master"
ESFP,"My cousin is flexible, very loving, very generous, very wise about people.  She does not seem to have Ne though and so I think she must be ESFP.  We connect like sisters.  Every once in a while she thinks my Ne statements are like ""What?"" though.  I wonder if I just adapt so well to her that we only talk Fi-Te.  It doesn't seem like I talk Ne much with her-- that is part of my puzzle is trying to figure out if I even talk about Ne stuff with her... it doesn't seem like it.  She is a realtor.  We both care about our relationships with our husbands and children as the big things we care about, also our personal emotional health.  Sex with our husbands is super important to us. Other than sex she's not into drugs or alcohol or sports or anything physical that I can think of.  She likes to read self-help books, likes movies and basically her job and being a good spouse and mother.   Moral-wise we are like 100%   I think she is ESFP.  What do you think?"
ESFJ,"My friend is an ESFJ, and she is always on the internet. I think most young ESFJ's can be found on tumblr, tbh."
INFP,"No, you don't understand that all I want is to freaking break free for once."
ESTP,"My mom and I shared evening walks together every day. It was where we bonded the most and where I learnt so much because she basically implanted ALL of her Ni ramblings into me. We walked together almost every evening for more than 12 years so you can imagine the amount of stuff she taught me over that period. Interestingly my mom despite her inferior Se was the one that taught us how to ride bikes, and played sports with us. In retrospect I can tell how much she struggled with that though, because she was almost always stressed afterwards. "
ISTP,"It's weird to me, to feel and then admit, that I feel such a tender feeling toward animals."
ESFP,"I value my family the most. They are the world to me. So it's important for me to have time with them, to call them and so on. And to try to be a good mum to my  daughter. "
INTP,"Originally Posted by crucio   Wow, I spent way too much time trying to wrap my head around that statement lol."
INFJ,"I can't be the only one who just doesn't trust a skinny or relatively in-shape chef, can I? I feel like they're the used car salesmen of the cuisine world. There's something so dishonest about it; how on earth can you be able to cook such decadent food (almost everything involves a full stick of butter) and turn the other way and make a friggin salad or something?? Heresy. I'll stick with the guy who looks to be 2-3 cheeseburgers away from a surprise trip to the ER."
ISTJ,"@SoftBoiledLife  I can relate. For me personally, the MBTI has made me realize that some of my faults are not faults at all. For instance, while I still need to work on socializing properly, I now know that there is nothing wrong with being tired at the end of the day and choosing not to. "
ISFJ,-it is hard for you to meet and connect to new people; you would much rather keep growing your already strong relationships instead.
INTJ,But I doubt I have a choice (in that I'm really not charming enough to get a girl to sleep with me in one nght).
INTJ,"Example: You want to tell someone to stop overeating. Do not tell them 'you will die of obesity if you carry on'. Bring up in casual conversation, 'oh wow, I found out that [insert thing they like eating] contains xxx! That's pretty shocking!'. "
ISFP,"I hate to admit it, but recently I've been feeling alone and bored on such an existential level  Even Internet can't completely satisfy my desire for novelty anymore... It just feels like my time to move out of my small hometown is long overdue... I crave new experiences!!"
ESTJ,"They are sadistic. They want you to be miserable. They want your existence to be bleak, consisting of virtually nothing but work. It's just a purely slave existence."
ISFP,@chicanai  ooh ooh my hubby is an ISTJ! He's amazing!
ESTP,"I've had women who can't find jobs in Canada shout at me from trailers about how bad America is and I usually check out when that happens lol. My sister is also underemployed but the Canadian myths about how ""ray cis"" America is is keeping her rooted to Canada. "
ESFJ,I leave all of my clean clothes in a laundry basket in front of my dresser and pick clothes out of it each day rather than fold them and put them away. I also leave clean clothes in the dryer until someone else needs to use it. I just hate laundry so much. It's my one true weakness.
ENFJ,"I used that bit of me that knows how to use my attention and affection, or withholding said attention or affection, to manipulate people tonight and now I feel SO BAD ABOUT IT. It helped salvage a friendship and it wasn't dishonest, really, but it was... manipulative. I don't know. Guh."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Artemis 2x4   What is your understanding of what makes a human a human being? I had this argument with my ENTJ and he tried to say that he was above being prone to mistakes like every other human being in the world and used the argument that a dog was prone to making mistakes? O.o I didn't understand and just stopped the argument. So I want to know what you guys think or see the question and if I am missing anything.    It's the gray matter.  I mean, my mind just went completely to physiology."
ENFP,Who do you think you are? Are you challenging me? Provoking me? Are out of your mind? Did you study Art History? Did you study Philosophy? Do you play an instrument? Are you a widely acknowledged painter perhaps?
INFP,"I don't know what it is really I set myself up for disasters I guess. Sometimes I think deep down I must enjoy the lonely because its all I've ever known. I let myself get put into situations where I know I'll feel lonely,I guess. I just hung out with my friend and her boyfriend and a couple of other friends and the whole time I was surrounded by people I felt lonlier than ever,it doesn't help of course to see couplings all around me."
INFJ,"Originally Posted by warweasel   absolute, pure joy.  (well.  Made me smile)      yay!"
ENTJ,"I am way too demanding and fickle in that sense. If the guy is quiet, I would nit pick a lot, and if he isn't, he would drive me crazy."
ESTP,"I don't relate to the Ni doubt thing, but bad outcomes of situations are usually less than a shock to me because I'm normally somewhat aware of how things are going to turn out."
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Hunny Bunny   No offense to any ENTPs, but it seems like a lot of them I've experienced like to put up what I call an ""asshole"" front.  Almost like an air like they are a player.  Any explanation for this, especially in relation to the love question I just asked?  ;-P"
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Napoleptic   I can handle (some) strong emotions - it's irrationality I can't deal with. :P    Perhaps this is a difference in semantics or maybe an overlap between strong emotions and irrationality in this situation. If a woman is emotionally aggressive about phoning for a date early on, then I think not only is this unreasonable, but also I would extrapolate out to what behavior would be coming my way when addressing a ""real"" or more difficult issue. I, too, can handle emotions; however, it is very taxing on me and I cannot and will not face too much of it. I'm in a position to be extremely picky on who I spend my valuable free time with...and placating overly emotional people is not on my ""to do"" list."
ENFJ,"I think you need to not feel guilty and tell this friend that this isn't for you at this time,"

Ok maybe i have.. umm.. reverse social anxiety!?! haha    It's weird, a lot of the time I didn't even realize that being alone was what was making me feel nervous until I finally get to be around people and it's like all the awful nervous loneliness melts out of my body.

ENTP,The question now is what I should do. Should I confess my shameful love for a show that I ought to dislike because of its geographical proximity to other shows I have found bad? Should I deny it and hope no one ever finds out? What if I like not liking something I actually like? O I'm such a mess.
ISTJ,Rant (pathetic whine): Another day of getting nothing sorted. I have major website programming to change (ajax and XML and good stuff like that) and people keep ringing up to bitch about non-essential crap.

ISTP,"p.s. he was unharmed.    I had an epic snow day tradition. First snow day of every year, I would drive to my school and do donuts on the unsalted parking lot (it was massive and clear of anything) and practice spinouts and trying to keep my truck under control on ice.

ESFP,"Crude example: When I see a teacup on his counter and I see a little crack in it, I think about how that is going to make a leak in the cup eventually and make a stain on the carpet, so I buy a new carpet for him even though nothing has broken yet. In this situation, my ESFP friend doesn't understand why I bought the carpet."
INFJ,"It is basically a rock musical (hence the ""Superstar"" in the title) by Andrew Lloyd Weber about Judas and Jesus and the Passion. It got two movie version too, one from the 70s and another from 2000. Now, be aware that the opinion of religious people about it is sort of divided, some groups were offended, but in either case I find it an interesting depiction (and great music too!)."

To me it feels like an art, the nuances and patterns fascinate me: things as simple as cause and effect: the pure sensation of what is actually happening and the possibilities and the absolute requirements. Maybe it sounds dramatic. But then again, so is art of any kind if you really think about it. It's stimulating. It helps you think. It helps you act. It helps you know. It helps you understand. It's an improvement, or at least a viewpoint, which is a start to an improvement. And perhaps on the outside it appears, or in fact, IS like I am taking it all lying down, head in the sand, coward, wimp, liar, two-faced, emotional, insecure, loner, but I feel the exact opposite when things get really tough like this, when there is an occasion to rise to, a leaking crack that needs a patch. I feel adventurous, I feel brave, I feel helpful, I feel logical and practical, I feel raw unbridled love: I feel capable, I feel energy, I feel creativity. It's a wordless rush. In fact in this instance: I can know that I have been capable, not only feel it. I can be sure and certain of what is happening, for the moment. I can see faintly, temporarily where it is going and how to get ahead of the curve if I am watchful. I can make plans, even, in my own weak way. Think out longer-term solutions, if I can stay in he groove long enough, if I can learn the nuances of the hole I'm filling, if I can be in an assisting and flexible role, and am listened to and equally considered."
INTP,unused introverted Feeling (Fi)  ********************************  (32.4)
ESTJ,I despise asking others for help and prefer to take care of things myself
ISFJ,Originally Posted by koalo   So now he tried to compensated his cold reaction by asking me about my problem again and again.
ISFP,"I'm pretty ecstatic. I'm getting my head shaved on Saturday, after which I'm going to Ulta to get a full-face makeover before going to a concert downtown. I haven't gotten so spruced up to go anywhere in I can't remember how long, and I also haven't had my hair so short in probably 3 months. I'm a little nervous but after seeing so many beautiful black women with shaved heads (along with being told by many people that I'm good-looking enough to pull it off again if I want to, because I've forgotten how I looked with it and feel like I've been hiding behind the wig I've been wearing,) I really want to experience being free in that way again."
INTJ,"Really I like just about any animal, but my favorite animals at the zoo are the vampire bats - they're really quite cute.  And I love watching the river otters twist and turn in the water - they're so playful and cute - and yet incredibly graceful at the same time."
ESTP,"The two ESTP's that I know will actually approach other people if we're all doing the same activity and the other person/people are somewhere in our general age bracket and halfway decent at the activity in question and strike up a conversation.  In fact, they could both talk to a light pole and it would probably answer."

ISTJ,Really wish they'd learn to not screw with things they have zero knowlege about. Dickheads!
ISFP,"Also, what are your thoughts like? What do you daydream about? (sorry for the barrage of questions, but I'm trying to figure out if I'm INFP or ISFP xD)    I'm in my head all the time. I fantasize about so much. What kind of life I wanna have, being in love and happy with someone, in a beautiful lively environment, and other romantic fantasies. I think about where I wanna be in terms of financially, being free, successful, talking, singing, dancing in an r&b group, in a music video singing a song i love. Many of my thoughts are like im a character in a show, where the events are things wish would happen to me....or the events are exaggerated but similar to where I can cope with existing events in my life now....I also worry a lot about if someone is mad with me, what someone is thinking, if i should do that or go this place today even though i dont want to...I live in my head."
ESTJ,- The one harassing the local co-ed sports league because the whole thing is disorganized. 
INFP,"Today is one of those ""I am not confident"" days. Could be all the heat.    What are you talking about? You're beautiful.. and yeah... I was actually planning to say it before reading your vent."
ENTP,"Twitch    And for that matter, what about blondes? Lol"
INFP,I feel so sad and drained now. Can't believe my own cousin betrayed me. I had a hunch and it was true
INFP,My ex told me in a rage that I would likely never find someone else because I am cripplingly shy. Perhaps she is right? But perhaps this shyness is a symptom of some deeper disability which has been with me my whole life and has even begun to manifest itself as a medical condition? I could quite literally be considered disabled in that I suffer from a mental health condition. So am I actually one of the people I have always dedicated myself to helping and are we drawn together not by choice but simply because we have been rejected by all others? 
INTP,I realized that the ENFP guy I'm crushing on actually facially reminds me somewhat of my first boyfriend (but he's got a waaaaaaay better body). I'm still trying to figure out exactly why those features and there are plenty of theories to choose between:
ENTP,"Are you Krang?    Unfortunately, there are still some people clever on the exterior. xD      Originally Posted by Obv   Making women shiver with anticipation is a useful skill.

And grabed the earlobe with my teeth, tongue, and lips and gently pulled away, not pulling on the ear really at all. Her eyes were closed, her mouth slightly open and I seen her whole body shiver. She was smiling as she opened her eyes. The rest of the night went very well."
ESFP,"I have a friend(?) that I've known for about 3 years now. For the past several months his communication tends to consist  of randomly calling me and then ignoring me for weeks. And then being like oh dude where you been? and then proceeding to ignore me again. Thing is, these random call/texts don't even last an entire conversation! I'm introverted and easily distracted, so I can go a while without communication, and I try to be nice, friendly, entertaining, easy-going... but I feel like either his attention span is retarded or he's just trying to prove that he can still get a reaction out of me, like maintaining a harem or something. The last one went like so:"
INFP,the same way just as you try and rationalize they will question what you found and go about
ENFJ,This thread has been extremely cathartic for me. It's the one place I come to when I'm in most need of just getting out all of my negative energy - so that I can continue to go on in life. 
INFJ,"Originally Posted by Dewymorning   @warweasel I did not realise Jesus Christ's middle name was Henry!    Well, what did you think the H stood for???"
INFP,It's horrible and I'm not usually like this but I really am just so angry
ENTP,"Also --- being open-minded and expecting others to be as such is also a form of negative judgement on others in a way. ""We're open-minded, therefore you should be as well"" has its own judgemental under-tones. However, I think what our saving grace is that our judgements don't last very long. Being open to new information and having the ability to analyze and assimilate it puts us in a position of what seems like inconsistent opinions and values - but that's honestly how I'm most comfortable. I'd rather continue to change my mind in the name of growth than fix myself into a rigid way of thinking."

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by HuggsX3   I really hate that I care so much about everything and everyone. I hate caring about the world. It's so depressing. I can't fix anything or help anyone. I have no clue what I'm doing with my life. Everything got screwed up and I got fucked over at school. Now I'm stuck and don't know if I can go back. I can't even decide on a career because I can't handle any helping profession classes without having a panic attack or becoming suicidal. Seriously there is no point to life anyway! My life will mean nothing in X amount of years. And I'm stressing about something that won't even matter anymore, which is life and the world in general. I'm frustrated.    But you can fix things and help people! You just need to find the right balance and the right people in your life. The way ENFJ's care so much is what makes them so amazing, but it is also very draining to them at times. "
ENTJ,"- Most importantly, I focus on a big dream (like travel) to put things in perspective  (e.g. I could go to that local music festival for $AUD250 or I could put that money towards a holiday in Berlin)."

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by timely.grace   I can definitely see this being true. I do enjoy being ""needed.""    I apologize, I know I can be blunt. I'm just worried that you desire to make people need you, because that is the only way you feel people will want you. It's not bad to feel needed at all, but if you are sacrificing your own mental health for it, it may be an unhealthy mechanism.

ESFP,It really depends. If the dragon actually started walking I'd be pretty impressed and a bit turned on and also terrified. On the other hand nothing brings excitement to a relationship like terror.

Mine is like let's just say i'm walking into a hall full of people i'd never knew before. I'll expect them all to like me without being really care to look like them, talk like them, wear a same kind of suit with them, etc. Instead, i'd rather expect i influence them to dress like how i dress, like whatever i like, etc but i wouldn't force them to. I wouldn't mind if they don't like me in the end, but i will prove and show them that it's wrong to dislike me for i am so likeable(lol just kidding. But that's how it works, at least in my mind). Generally, i prefer to keep things impersonal with people because i'll be annoyed if they're being so emotional and sentimental in front of me and i tend to react aggresively; not angry, more like an explosion. Is that Fe or Fi?"
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by BIGJake111   It can definitely be a pain and it's by no means all fun and games. From an outward view we always have our shit together. We tend to have achievement and safety in our assets. That doesn't mean that it's easy for us to achieve or easy for us to hold onto these assets and usually the only reason we have the things we do is because we don't allow ourselves to have anything less, be it something that's impressive to have if we are a 3 or something that's impressive to have overcome being an 8."

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by ToughLilCookie   I think relationships is where we often wonder why everyone would want to be an ENTJ.  I agree from an outward view, we do appear always together and always with plan B if plan A does not work.  Where I get the most confused, and maybe where I confuse others the most as well, is when I do show any weakness.  I know I've disappointed or even surprised others when they see a chink in my armor.  My best friends see the chinks and accept them as part of me.  It's when I'm in a romance and being somewhat over-idealized due to my strengths that I have been deflated by lack of acceptance of a romantic partner when any weakness is shown, or use of that weakness to characterize me.  It turns into a mess when I mend the ""chink,"" so to speak, and make a comeback into strength, after someone I cared about pokes a stick into it.  Does anyone here understand what I'm trying to say?    Aside from a romantic partner, do you (I'm addressing any ENTJ's on the thread to jump in here) choose people to be in your inner circle, or do too many people already choose you to be in theirs? If you make a few closer friends on purpose, what is the criteria or trigger? I'm asking because I think most of my own relationships have been incidental, without being very satisfying, and I want to stop doing this. I've asked INTJ's and now looking for viewpoints from more extroverted NT's."

She told me and I can understand and did tried to sympathize with her, something Im not very good at. She told me she collected all his pictures and have it as a wallpaper on her computer. She kept the same number just in case one day he'll leave me and run back to her. She clearly stated that she was seeking therapy for the longest but ever since she met him ONLINE (key word), she did better in therapy. Yeah, they have never met in person. She only lives 30 minutes away from us but they were talking online for 2 years prior to me meeting him.

I tried to fix everything by myself which just made everything worse because I kept on judging and began losing my body language, voice, my family, my feelings, my memory and as a result I lost my ability to fully function.(Depersonalization and Derealization is not an experience I would wish for anyone) It felt like there were two personalities fighting against each other and the robot was winning. My memories and all aspects of my previous self began to fade. When I explicitly reached out to people, I began to snap out of it and realized that we are important to the people we encounter. No matter how useless and unimportant we might seem, we are all special in our own way and no one can fill the hole left by us when we depart. So prepare yourself for the fight of your life. We're fighting for ourselves and everyone in the future who we're going to change to fight for humanity's survival and the power of love.

Her responses were kind of short but she did say ""Thanks for the flowers"" ""I appreciate that"" and I ended the talk to give her space from then on...im just waiting to see if she will ever reach out to me now. Would this leave a lasting impression on her? We did spend pleasant times together in the past 5 months, I feel like I messed up because I didn't express myself to her clearly, being a very allusive INFJ, I have been careful with my emotions, because either they are too little or too much for people to handle, especially if I like someone.

ENTJ,- If there are any changes to the process be sure the explanation and logic for why are communicated to the entire team. It's okay to change course but it should be justified. Examples:
ESTP,"Originally Posted by pinkrasputin   Is it true I can find an ESTP man in a grocery store?  If not, where can I find you?  You're usually all so busy ""doing"". I need you to slow down and look around once in a while.     In my case yes, you can find an ESTP in a grocery store. Where would we be looking around? And will you accept procrastination as slowing down?"

ENTP,Between two (if i absolutely had to choose) i would pick hares. I know doesn't sound logical but the first one lives in the wild while puppies live at home.
ESFJ,you know your and ESFJ when you start to think INFP's are an unsolvable Enigma .... my moms and ESFJ and she seems to just try and try and try to understand me and just fails miserably .... she think she does ... but thats because i kind of let her off and make her think she has so she doesn't waste energy  truth is she has only rubbed the surface and hasn't even scratched it
ISTP,"They've given Count Paris a new first name. So we have Romeo, Mercutio, Tybalt, and... Dave?"
ISFJ,Paranoia is the more conscious form of this stuff...maybe to try and give a little structure: 
ISTP,"I think the reason animals are always happy to see us, and people often aren't or are indifferent is because we don't worry ourselves with considering how they feel around us. We see them as higher, cognitive beings who should be completely capable of controlling their own emotions. "
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Megs1090   So for the few ppl that might remember me posting somewhere in the forum about a particular INFP... I would just like to say that my world is in equilibrium now, and we are dating. My feelings are generally: Yaaaaay!!!! "
INFJ,"why am i so obsessed with the expiration date of everything, when it comes to any relationship with anyone? is there a plane that can go pick up my mind from wandering out there in the potential future and deliver it back to the present so i can be ""here"" in the moment? this is a crazy science fiction life and the really strange thing is the de ja vu when you go back to the future you already created in your mind and re-live it in the actual world instead of in fantasy."

ISFJ,"i think ISFJs don't let their feelings show easily, especially at the start of a potential relationship and the more info they get the better they feel.. well, i'm talking about myself really.. the more the other person opens up to me the more confident i'll feel to reveal my thoughts and feelings.. otherwise i'll feel too insecure and unsure how the other person feels about me.. i do love my ISTP bf, but sometimes communication can be a little challenging because as you say it's not always easy to know what to talk about..

I've had some heavy E experiences in the past that really made me feel myself, but I've lived my whole life trying to be introverted (due to fear of being hurt, etc).

INTP,"Originally Posted by devoid   I don't think people ever really decide to hurt the other person intentionally, unless they're really that much of a sadist. People often hurt each other just as easily by accident. Perhaps there is a point at which people stop caring whether or not they hurt the other person by accident, though. Some people never really seem to care from the beginning. Randomly, this thought seems to sync very well with the I'm listening to.    Love Emancipator, that anthem song is so good. I guess there's some deep down need some people have to hurt each other, like maybe the hurt equals them caring about what you think and feel or some power game.

INTP,"I am happy because what I am most often worried about is mental illness. For years I was terrified I'd become schizophrenic. Then for a while I was terrified I'd become bipolar. I still worry about these things from time to time, but right now I am rejoicing in the fact that nearly everything I think/worry about is documented online as being related to OCD! I even have pretty daily fears that I am somehow racist/homophobic/pedophilic/murderous/suicidal etc., even though I am none of those things. I am about as socially liberal as possible, I have many non-white, non-straight friends, yet I frequently think ""Oh god, what if I am racist/homophobic?"" It's ridiculous, because I am not those things/don't have any of those sentiments, yet the fearful thoughts intrude anyway. I lost sight of the reason for a while, and started taking them seriously. But now I have again realized that they are simple intrusive thoughts. Also, the fear of bipolar is sort of ridiculous. Yeah, I have energetic weeks and I have fatigued weeks. I have happy moments, I have glorious moments, and I have difficult, glum moments. But never do I feel INSANE with my positivity, never do I appear to anyone as a raving lunatic, high on speed or something. And never do I lie in bed all day, crying my eyes out or wanting to die. Sure, I have dealt with some pretty bad depression, but I think it is safe to assume that it is not bipolar-related and not clinical depression."
INFP,"Poetry is the bane of my existence, and I prefer writing to reading also."

I am, according to her, the messiest person in the world. I went to a J friend's place, and her room was messy as well. But I felt right at home in her room. It is very nice and lived in. I can't stand places which are too neat. It makes me twitchy. Neatness is a J trait I do not have. "

ESFJ,"Actually this is definitely an ESFJ thing to do. Personally I don't like to force anything upon people, but when I was younger I was very quick to give my opinion and to force upon people my beliefs of right and wrong, mostly where it was unwanted (even worse). You will probably see this with underdeveloped, immature, and even some adult ESFJs. It's unfortunate when adults act like pushy and controlling children and believe they're right all the time. Fortunately, a couple of years of maturing and much observation led to a better understanding of the way I acted and my personality in general. I'm deathly aware of these things presently, which helps me prevent myself from bad habits. Not sure if this is also a general SJ quality, but definitely an ESFJ quality (depending on the person)."

I expect so because it's a pretty common trait among certain psychological mindsets - the need to feel 'wanted'."

I could PM you some articles and videos about INFJs I know of, and you could use that to tell her about your type. It should make more sense to her if you pander it to her style of learning.

I told him sorry, I couldn't be with him because I needed to feel something to be with someone and that I had never really felt anything for anyone. Also, I was like I did that with that random guy because I was like - someone wanted me and well, I needed reassurance that I was attractive, that someone actually wanted me (wow, that sounds bad).

ENFJ,"Ah the typical ENFJ, generalising that all people are the same towards you when one or two people 'kick you in the guts'.  I too am guilty of doing this.  But you need to isolate it to only the people who really did upset you, and see how you can make the situation right ie. confront them, or move on.  You should make a conscious decision to be happy too, or else everywhere you look for misery, you will find it.  What I say comes from my own experience, you can leave those feelings behind and be happy. The choice is yours.  And I hate to rain on your parade, but the grass never is greener on the other side.  Whatever your issues now, you will have the same ones in another country until you learn to deal with things differently.  I am by no means thinking that I know it all, but I went through some terrible moments last year and I am feeling more like me now that I have embraced a better, more positive attitude."
ESFP,"I just like my friend very much and want to share my real self with him, like the full measure of how intensely I feel things, without being off putting. (Can you tell I have a lot of SJ scars?? haha) Any other advice about INFJ behavior that ESFPs can't stand is most welcome.    I appreciate it.  I only find it boring if it's boring.  I know that's kind of a cop-out answer, but the thing is, like everything else it's situational.  If you're a good storyteller, then it's not boring.  But I will want to participate in the conversation.  If it's just a monologue, I'll lose interest.  But yeah, in general I love people opening up to me about feelings and personal experiences.  Those things appeal to my feelings and make me feel good that I'm getting attention.

ISTP,- took muay thai classes at my school during first term and loved it (and will do the same for the next 3 years);
ISFJ,"It's also a reason why we (I) need some sort of periodical positive confirmation of my abilities and/or personality, or this particular Ti-Ne thing might lead a life on it's own and tell me I suck anyway, even though I'm doing an awesome job at whatever."
INTP,"I don't want it to go away, but I know it will cause I have to go to sleep eventually. "
ENFJ,"As a personal opinion, I would not focus on how to control the outside world, but rather how to be stronger the next time someone betrays you. If you manage to get stronger every time there will be a moment when nobody will be able to brake you. It doesn't matter if something hurts as long as you keep growing every time to face it."
INTP,"Random Thought #2 -- I've been researching Creatine products and have started doing a lot of home exercises with pull-ups, chin-ups, squats, lunges, and so on. I need more information about the conversion of ADP to ATP and the replenishment of phosphates. Working out at a gym seems too expensive and too distracting. I think this routine will work well for now (I have started two weeks ago, and have noticed an increase in lift and repetition)."
ISFJ," @JennyJukes I'm sorry you were bullied in school for that, I was too for the same reasons. I have an older INFP brother I've always been close to. Especially when I was growing up I always followed him around and wanted to be like him/imitate him, and I think a lot of my humor came from that. Also, my dad is ENFP and my mom was INTP(possibly INFP) and things like creativity/humor/questioning things were always encouraged growing up, so I've always wondered how much that affected me as an Si dom. I was wondering if it would be more likely for ISFJ males to mistype as INTP or come across that way. I've heard that a lot about INFJ males, but not much about ISFJ males. "
ENFJ,"One last piece of advice that I think is very important for ENFJs to consider when they find themselves overwhelmed is that you can't do everything or influence everyone in the 'right' way, nor is it even necessarily the right thing to do. (Even if you can see a path of destruction opening before you). Also, in a strange way, always making yourself responsible for others is actually a form of selfishness, in thinking that you always CAN make a difference. I never thought of it that way until fairly recently, but I realized it really is true, and, as weird of a use of ""selfishness"" that is, it's really changed my perspective on how I deal with 'failing' to change others and/or situations."

ESTP,SJs work as a sense of obligation as describee by most of them. Se users tend to view work as more of an interest with regards to keeping busy.

ENTJ,1. How do the ENTJ's on this forum celebrate the end of a tough contract/job? 
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Clyme   I have this experience as well, with the exception of your ending comment. I don't find the stories or opinions boring and I don't get irritated. I actually really enjoy getting to know people because I live vicariously through their ups and downs. As far as keeping my mouth shut though and trying not to share my thought process, that's what I do experience, because I'm viewed as stupid and similar things. I live in this world of ideas, theories, concepts, abstractions, and so forth. I'm apt to talk about some random person from history who has no immediately tangible bearing on present-day reality, only because I am moved by their ideas. However, when I translate these sorts of things (of which they're very important to who I am) into conversations with an ISFP, I find that communication breaks down and I'm viewed as annoying, tiresome, and stupid. So, I tend to keep my mouth shut about these things and come on this forum to satisfy that instead."
ENTP,Is the best way to mess with ENTPs to act supermushy towards them?
ESFJ,"I just joined this forum and I was wondering the same. When I'm drifting through the threads I find other types coming in to so speak for us. With ""My mom is an ESFJ..."" or blah blah blah.  I'm an ESFJ and I practically attached to my laptop. I visit forums, YouTube, Steam (video game platform), and other random sites that I find interest in. I read a lot of ""they're out socializing"" posts in the ESFJ forum and that makes me feel that I'm not as Extroverted as I would like to think because I don't like going out much. I like to socialize sporadically. I'll leave and spend the night at a family's house or friend for a few days and then I'm home for a while. Or I'll be out of the house doing stuff for a week and then it's like I have to hibernate after that."

ENTP,"I do think you shouldn't read too much in it, though. Clothes can reflect personality, but that's not always in the way you think they do. You might think that someone is trying to show off, while she's just wearing the sweater her grandma knitted for her a month before she passed away. This wedding was special because grandma knew this couple as well and everyone had hoped she would make it. And because she was going to wear that sweater no matter what, she took the first dressy thing that somehow matched in color and decided to wear it. You see? "

I'd rather have you be yourself around me than wearing some mask :)    Wording your criticism in a way that is more palatable to the person on the receiving end is not wearing a mask...it's being considerate of their feelings and showing them respect. While perception and intent are after 2 different things, knowing your bluntness will result in another perceiving your criticism negatively and still choosing to frame your criticism bluntly just shows you don't care what they think or how they feel. If that's the case,  why should you care enough to say it and, as such, what's the point in sharing in the first place?"
ISFP,"New Year's resolutions are dumb because nobody fulfills them even as much as they like to fabricate details. I kinda set some goals for myself this year, though.... like getting out more, talking more with others, finally being brave enough to go somewhere independently, feeling comfortable in social situations.... and while I don't find myself as socially anxious, per se, I still really feel comfortable with other introverts and nerdy people.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by itsme45   What do you mean by ""getting through"" to her? Make her understand she should change? :P Sounds like you have a problem with her entire being, having judged her pretty negatively in several aspects (I see nothing positive mentioned here), don't be so idealistic as to think you can change someone so completely to conform to your standards. Someone who has actual empathy for her could perhaps get through to her but I can't say more than this pretty generic thought, sorry. Not enough details or anything either.    I apologize. I should have been more clear. When I say get through to her, I mean how do I get her to open up to those who love her and care about her? A lot of her behavior is not positive. I won't lie to make it seem otherwise. My aim isn't to change her ""being"", but rather to get to the underlying issue of why she feels the need to say derogatory things to her sister, mother, and father. But so far her ISFJ sister and ESFJ mother have been kind of passive aggressive and frustrated. The ESTP does have a tendency of cursing out her family members. So I understand their frustration, though I can't stand the fact that they get passive aggressive (of which I've expressed my disapproval to them). "
ENTP,- How many drinks before someone typically types it right?
INFJ,"I had my son get his haircut by my aunt who is very interested, I am fairly certain she is an ESFP. (she is super awesome btw!) She is the ONLY one in the family who understands the gripes I have with a few of my more quirky characters in the family - Not including me of course, because I am fantastically stupid, not frustratingly stupid  Totally being a jerk for fun. I love everyone in my family. "
ESFJ,3. You expecially love people that appreciate you for who you are! (Infp's! <3)
ESFP,"As far as the second one - Getting desired result without planning is achieved through high tactical intelligence, being able to make the right moves in the moment based on the environment and the situation we are presented with.  The more we ""just do something"" the more we get used to the possible reactions/outcomes and become more skilled at reacting to what is thrown at us.  And as ESFPs especially, we sometimes achieve desired results simply from our charm and likability, regardless of what anyone else has planned for."

My employer won't ask what grade I got on a specific subject. Also, I'm already working on a very lenient Virtual Pet Site and have been offered a full-time job by a company for when I graduate. I just need to sign their contract and it's no pressure to me since I can decide just before graduation. I just don't want to disappoint my parents."

ISFJ,"  I've chosen the path of Christianity, but you have to remember there are so many people who focus on different facets within that religion.  I'm reading a very good book called ""Making Sense of the Bible"" by Adam Hamilton (a Methodist minister.)  I highly recommend it to anyone who may follow Christianity and yet question the Bible.  It points out inconsistencies within the Bible and forces the reader to think for themselves based on facts of events that were happening at the time the Bible was written, and how it is applicable for us today.  Fascinating read, and admirable for a well respected minister to write something so controversial."
INTJ,A religious discussion that remained civil??? Amazing.
ISFP,"You're an ISFP. What does your Fi make you do?    I dunno... introspection? Reflecting emotion, and sometimes overwhelmed by it?"
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Jimmers   I've never been what I would call a religious person, but I've always believed in God. I was baptized Catholic and received First Communion. I connected with the Church when I was really young, but my parents would never take me to church even though I asked for them to. I think they had bad experiences when they were kids, plus they were part of that generation that started cutting ties with religion. Anyways, lack of church and love of science pushed me into a certain direction and my love of learning about he world through science mostly replaced my spiritual needs. In college I became agnostic, but a new age friends taught me a few things about spirituality, and that renewed my desire for the divine, if only temporarily. After college I dabbled in Native American spirituality and other earth spiritualities. Then after reading Tolkien I found out he was a devout Catholic. That got me reinterested in exploring my Catholic roots. I found beauty in the church, the rituals, the music. I had my first daughter baptized in the Church. I felt like I was making some head way in my life until a coworker made me feel like such an idiot for believing in anything because she was a militant atheist(her words, not mine). It crushed me. Since my faith wasn't that strong yet I eventually let it go. Then I became an atheist. I read some Dawkins, Hitchens, and a few others. I felt that was the lowest I have ever felt and the opposite of kind of person I was up to that point in life. After that I moved away from atheism and moved into spirituality again, checking out zen, taoism, hinduism. I went to a zen sangha. I checked out unitarian universalism. But what I felt I really needed was a church, the community, the beauty. I don't care much for theology or doing things according to some doctrine, but I have a strong need to belong, to love others, and be loved, to do good in the world. I don't feel I can belong to the Catholic Church because of the priest scandals, the politics mixing with religion, the divisiveness. Plus because I don't care much for absolute truth and doctrine, and I don't see anything wrong with people being gay, lesbian, or with priests being married, or with women clergy. I don't see the big deal. Each person is unique, that is the way we born. We should honor that as long as no one is harming anyone else. So I checked out an episcopal church, not because of some ideology but because they don't make such a fuss over silly things like birth control and sexual preference. That way I can focus on community, family, and the beauty of world, the beauty of the services, while nurturing my spirituality and making a difference in the world. That has always been a hard thing to balance, my need for spiritually with my distrust of organized religion, sometimes the structure of it is just suffocating, but I'm getting to that point in my life where I have to nurture my soul. Okay, I'm done rambling now. I just needed to get all that all out! Thanks for listening :)    I love all of this thank you, I think you have perfectly summed up where I am in my own life now, I am glad you have found a place where you can nurture this drive within yourself, I often feel that drive and have desperatly searched for something to fill that void, I hope I can be as lucky as you some daya nd find a church where I belong also."

I kept a cool face so that I looked like I knew what I was doing. "
ISFJ,"Basically, I have to force ego to forget about itself long enough to stop feeling self-conscious.

Now, we may not have the skill set that would be ideal for it from the onset, but we are confident that we can figure out a solution that will result in the promised end goals. Completely bull shitting our asses off makes a bigger mess to clean up later. There have been a million moments that were not ideal and I had to make chicken shit into a chicken salad. At those times personal confidence, adaptability and creativity is invaluable. I quickly try to get the situation back to a controllable foundation, but when the choice is ""sink or swim"" I have no intention of finding out how deep the water is. The key is setting expectations fairly."

As a child, being raised by a single ESTJ mother who worked all the time, I was similar to what you are describing. I was very anxious and shy towards people and almost feared them. I definitely became better at reading other people's emotions, but it took time. Do you ever find yourself wanting human interaction or are you perfectly content being totally alone for long periods of time? Can you describe yourself and how a normal day would be for you? The more details the better!    I used to be very social, and now I'm a lot more withdrawn, because of rejection. I used to love being the center of attention. Then I just got mocked and insulted because no one could appreciate me for having the courage and confidence to be different and display that. So now, to repeat, I'm a lot more reserved than I was.

It's my life, and people should know better than to ask for such random time lots!"

Right now, I just don't want to be in a clear state of mind, I don't want to be able to think right now. I don't want to even hear my own thoughts. For ten hours, I was able to fall asleep, I think those where the best ten hours of non-reality I can ever feel so far. Ultimately, I don't think I would ever find myself going on a binge or anything like that. I just think I'm starting to understand what it feels like to want to escape from reality. I just don't feel like I want to be me to be me right now. I can also understand I was able to pass off as a strong ""thinker"" before. I spent a year at home, there were times where I haven't smelled fresh air for months. I was disillusioned knowing that my friends didn't see me anymore, they moved on. I thought to myself then, ""friends come and go, everything does, but only I remain."" Just me and my thoughts. There was a time when I was fascinated with machinery. I admired their efficiency, I admired how they got the job done. I admired how their feelings didn't get in the way or inhibit them, they got the job done and that was important. I think to myself, ""maybe I should be a machine."" I wouldn't have to wast so much time on wastful thoughts. And if I ever did think, it would be about getting things done. Efficiency. No more shards of glass in my head. No more emptiness in what appears in its stead. No clutter, no void. Just for a moment, I want nothing. I fear it is almost time for me to go."

I am in a happy period of my life, but I am constantly afraid that I will become depressed again. That's terrifying.

Am I dissatisfied because I am in a bad situation or because I am a dissatisfied person? Well, at least life is beautiful...    I like Creep.

That's a vicious circle which keeps you focusing on yourself, instead of choosing to be present in the moment and focusing on the other person, what they're saying and their emotional state.  I did eventually discover that if I were truly present in the moment, listening and noticing, the right words would come even though I wasn't ""thinking"" about it.

ENFJ,And I just found out that my mother lost her aunt today :/ She was the last surviving member of my mom's earlier generation. My grandmother's entire generation gone :/ It's such an odd feeling. Mom was completely heart broken and I got so drained by the end of it :/ It's like the past few days every ounce of life is slowly being sucked out of me. I have so many things to worry about ... It's moments like this I wish I still had my keyboard. I feel waves of unresolvable feelings wash over my body. So many things are happening on so many fronts. I'm so drained that it feels like my system will collapse any minute. But I'm doing the best that I can to keep my spirits up. I just can't break down. I just can't break down. I just can't ... I wish I could stop feeling. I wish I could keep these hot chills from shooting down my back. It's like getting hit by wave after wave of emotion.
INTP,Originally Posted by LeaT   Which is funny because I wasn't even trying to be. There are studies that show that we prefer partners who seem to have a very opposite genetic makeup to that of ourselves as well.    That is true. The phrase tickled my fancy for two reasons:

ENFP,"[QUOTE=sweatherbee5;5618578]I believe I'm an ENFP, and it takes a lot to make me angry as well. Most people have never seen me actually angry. However I have ""blown up"" a few times. Since I don't get angry at little things, I sometimes let people treat me crappy. For instance, I had a best friend who I let walk all over me. Eventually, I got mad over one thing and told her all the things she had done to make me mad in HUGE detail, it was baddd. I was very angry. I was over the anger within two weeks and apologized. We were best friends again.. I guess. Now, about a year later, I did the same thing again, except different. I got mad, but in a different way. I just didn't care. So I told her why I was mad in vague detail, argued with her for a few minutes, and then it was over. I'm not mad anymore, I'm just done! I relate to you on the way you get angry, but I can have freak out anger moments where I am not calm."
ENFJ,I had two friends in middle school. They fucked me over.
ESFP,"Being good with people, but not so good that I have to kiss their ass. "
ISFJ,"@Everett  Yes, as a woman I intuitively know when something is wrong with my children or if something is upsetting someone I love when they don't let it show. Sometimes I will feel like something is off, put it out of my mind and later find out there was. It's like a little whisper in my head saying ""something is wrong here, this doesn't feel right"" I think this is a normal human trait, it's just stronger in some and weaker in others. I am still ISFJ, no doubt in my mind. Don't worry, these tests are not written in stone."
ISTJ,Looks like I'll be going to Germany with my family during summer 2012. For three weeks. Visiting family and such.

ENTP,How important is it to be efficient or to work? Can you easily change a plan you made for the day if something else comes in the picture? How open are you to taking impulsive decisions?
ENTJ,I complained that her shake was jiggling my hand forward and back as well as only moving up and down a limited amount (more of a jiggle).

Even if they're suffering because of their bliss, this time they're bringing it on themselves this time around. And until they break again, I can't help them. I should distance myself from them, but that involves deepening a friendship with another social group that accepts me in the area, or someone who is actually waiting for me to come back around.."
INFP,"Me: Oh, thank you, you beautiful, quiet, fast printer."
ENFJ,Yeah lately weekends are when I can spend the most time on here so that is when I post the most. I try to sneak on during the week but time just gets in the way.
INTJ,"I used to be a bit more of a workaholic before I went to uni, but as soon as I left home I became a procrastinator extraordinaire.  It all started when I was told that my first-year marks didn't count towards my final degree classification so I only needed to get 40% in each module.  I didn't see the point in aiming much higher until second-year, when the procrastination had already become part of my lifestyle."
INTP,"I suppose we could debate what it means to be ""messed up,"" but simply sitting around and thinking that you're damaged goods, so you might as well just sit on the shelf, is an excuse after awhile. Especially if you haven't really tested any of these theories. Like I said, you just need to take a leap sometimes. "
ISFJ,"6) When it takes weeks, months, years to tell someone something important because you're scared of what they might think of you and whether they'll hate you if you tell them, and when you plan what you're going to say so much before, only to not know what to say when you finally get to the conversation. When, even after the conversation goes well, you reanalyze everything that you/they said over and over again because you're sure you did something wrong. And when they tell you something, you're scared you said or didn't say something wrong, and you're so scared they think you don't care, but you couldn't possibly care any more, and you don't know how to show them that."
ENTJ,Why would you think there is a relation between understanding somebody  else behavior and doing YOUR things different?(in this point you could say you could get the best way but that best way its directly related to the guy  aka  NOT  WALKING AWAY).

INFP,"Why do people always try to talk to me when I'm in no mood for being talked to. I don't need to be told what to do with myself, I just want people to fuck off a bit without my needing to explain everything to them."
ISFP,Having no career or career direction isn't something I am not fond of since I don't like my job that much.  I don't like food and not very big on the retail scene.  So glad I am on two weeks paid vacation.
ENFP,"For example: when I am playing against a <2200, I always play Pirc with black to e4. It's flexible, I have my bishops and most people don't know it that well. It takes precision to take down the Pirc and I mostly draw in the middle only to win the endgame because I have more time left. "
INFP,"In the end, she never held my hand and I never went on that crazy trip. But lots of things had happened since then, and I have changed so much from coming and going, leaving and leaving. "
ISFP,"Well, now it'll be off to college soon I suppose. Lesson learned. Social life, here I come."
ISTP,"I'm not that creative, for real.    Double DD is perfect."
ENTJ,"But I only earn like 1k in my current job.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by The red spirit   I am very VERY scared of flying with plane. Worst part was taking off. I nervously ate 200 grams of gummy bears. My dad checked my pulse while I was flying and it always was over 100 bpm. He could check this while plane was taking off and landing, but I could predict that it could have been around 160bpm. Thank god, I haven't vomited, crapped my pants or started yelling. I just can't stand feeling of instability of G force. I wish I was dead. I will have to fly again this friday and I'm scared to death of it. Anyone had same experiences? How you deal with them?    I work for an airline (on the ground), but I'm not a huge fan of heights in general either. Mentally, I try to separate ""normal"" heights (like standing on a tall building) from flying in a plane. Treating it like a train or a bus or even a building might help a bit."
ISFJ,"A bit neurotic, perhaps, but Woody Allen moved that attitude firmly into the mainstream. "
ENTJ,"I frequently bump across people who take grave things very lightly. Like, when a new person joins your group, I have no idea what compels people to not accommodate that new individual and instead see him as an outsider, someone who can never truly be a part of the group. Not only that harms the integrity of the group, it also misses out on the potential value the newbie may add to the whole. I have had at least 2-3 fights with my friends on this kind of behavior and they always ask me why the hell am I so uptight about this. Then there was another occasion when people at a wedding started parking illegally and that was obstructing the path for not only the guests but also the pedestrians who walked by. I have no fucking idea why the management was not concerned with it and when I lashed out on them, they were surprised. "
ISTJ," ""Ill-conceived"" was the nicest term I could think of that was still somewhat descriptive of the statements I read in your post.     Likewise with ""my foot"""

ISFJ,"Of course, I can only dream of the perfect new friend conveniently reaching out to me. I need someone who can lead me to a bigger network of friends, who won't know me and therefore won't judge my every action by my past, who listens to me enough but can push me along when I need it, and who will let me in. I just get so upset thinking of how I made no new friends last year because the friend I came in with wasn't interested in making new friends because she had me and she has her boyfriend. She talked to people in all her classes and had friends for group projects and she didn't even want new friends. I just hated watching her easily attain something she didn't even want. "

I'm a problem solver, and solving interesting problems is great for me personally. If I help people along the way it just makes it better by putting a weight behind it. I'm a bit less consistent when it comes to politeness: I'm very polite, sometimes even too polite (holding doors for streams of people, etc.), but I also run my mouth a lot (classic ENTP trait) and don't really give a fuck for people's sensitivities. I can be blunt and sarcastic but also very comforting. I can be loud and brash but I am often quite shy. ENTPs are walking, living, breathing contradictions. Also, not all female ENTPs on the web are jerks, just check out HarleyJinx for an example (too lazy to link her channel)    Lol thanks. Sorry about the rant, I think all of my frustration was coming out in that post and my fi was obscuring what I was trying to articulate. Your comment helped answer a lot of my questions."

ENTP,I do not think the type would put a significant change on the number of ENTP that might be needed except in relation to the size of the bulb.  Extra hands might be advisable to lessen the chance of breakage.  I also do not believe there would be a requirement for the extra hands to belong to an ENTP.

Granted in Thor 1, it seemed the opposite, but after that the rest of the movies have Loki as a talker... Kind of a happy-go-lucky-in-an-evil-way talker. Maybe an ENFJ? Or perhaps an ESFJ? Lol.

Yeah, but the other, more reputable sources I found just said 'yeah, there are some Visigothic surnames' as well. Where do you get from that those that have these last names are neccesarily more judgemental and arrogant thanks to the Visigothic influence, even if they actually are (keep in mind, we aren't talking about a few leaders, but about enormous families)? After all, the Visigoths came to Spain many, many generations ago. They have mixed with the 'original' Spanish so thoroughfully... how much does a last name tell you? Two of my sisters married Dutch men, and their Childeren will have Dutch surnames, but there's no doubt that my family is German. Imagine that going on for generations and generations. How strong could the correlation between surname and cruelty (stemming from Visigoth descent, which I doubt, honestly, you still don't give me where that gomes from) possibly be?"

ESFJ,"People on here who say negative things about ESFJs have most likely just had bad romantic experiences with them because as friends they're pretty good, although for a stubborn INTJ like myself, they can be a headache and, for the most part, are best as acquaintances.  We don't hate your type (although I'm sure some do), we just desperately want to UNDERSTAND your type, and that's consistently difficult to do when you get close to them."

ESTP,"Originally Posted by Jawz   That F>T can lead to this ... Basically when you tease, you give the signal that you're perfectly ok with it being done to you and sometimes people tend to take it far. There is a way to create boundaries in a positive manner .. You just have to learn the best way to react to something that went too far in the moment right there and then. There's no point in letting the moment pass and then trying to establish boundaries at a later date imo. That creates more friction.    Awesome advice, thanks! I tried it today (went too far again, but this time I started it haha) and just told him straight without making a big thing of it, and he stopped.

Everything suggests she finds me interesting (including telling me over and over again), but she almost always takes 1 or 2 days to respond. She has been very busy as of late. But before then, throughout the whole time I've known her she has taken this amount of time. Once she told me ""I don't respond because then I would have to end up talking to you for hours"" (??) I don't really get it.    I see.  As darc said, it's an energy thing and once you start talking to someone you're committing to it.  Me personally if I like someone I want to know everything and talk to them all the time but that's not the case for everyone.  Some ISFJs move much, much slower and get drained quicker.  I'm a type 2 sx, so that might have something to do with it."

INFP,"It kinda brings people out of their shell and lets them be a bit playful.

As a matter of fact, I know an ISFJ who has done that quite a few times, too.

OK I know I am lazy; I like to sit in front of my computer or read books rather then socialize and I take my studies over my job and I can't wait for my summer job to be over so I can go back to school and people just roll there eyes and say that I can't be a student forever and that I am so lazy and blah blah blah. 
ISTP,"On a side note, operating a microwave oven with an insufficient load is usually not very good for the magnetron tube. The generated microwaves have nowhere to go and are reflected back to the magnetron, over heating it, which lessens its life span."

Not sure though.    I agree with Whatexists. I don't even have a 'mission' or factual 'goal' in my life. I'm more attuned to experiences and how I want to feel. But this could be true for INFPs as well. Maybe everyone gives a different meaning/declination to 'purpose', among the same type, too."

ESFP,"Originally Posted by FeliciteM   ESFP pet peeves...being stuck behind people that walk slow and having to ""carry"" someone whenever they go out.

I know this sounds kind of funny but we are such people pleasers, that if we see someone that doesn't do a good thing for others, we automatically have a hard time with that person. We place a lot of value in helping others."

Obviously, if I can recognize that all of the graduate students dress professionally in school, isn't it implied that I also recognize that if I was a graduate student, I too would have to dress professionally?"
INFP,"I feel like I'm ready to face my problems and find myself. Even close friends know something's wrong that others don't..I feel uncomfortable in my own skin sometimes.  That's because I'm not true to myself. So it's time to start discerning the truth from the lie, and found out my blacks and whites, to influence all of these wonderful activities, events, hobbies, people, ideas, friendships, and strangers I've encountered, embraced, and met.

As an ENFP, I like to think my passive agressive posts are a code that can't be cracked, but it doesn't really take a genius to realize I'm complaining about someone/something or something is bothering me. But I don't like confrontations. I don't know any type that likes them, and that's not necessarily an ENFP thing, but if someone takes the confrontation on themselves, then I will respond truthfully, sometimes without tact, but always without any agendas. I don't like playing games and I want things to be resolved. "
ENTJ,CRs: Social welfare has become a crutch that is bankrupting the government. The role of government is to ensure the proper use of force; not social welfare. It must be reformed in order to regain fiscal stability.

ISFP,"I love the ISFPs I know. The one I'm sure of and that I'm closest to, my cousin, is so great. We can sit in a room all day and not talk, just keep each other company and its super chill and awesome and not lonely or awkward. I love going places with her because we have the same style of exploring, and she appreciates just absorbing the place and seeing it and getting the feel of it rather than being a tourist. And we both love quirky indie stuff. And I be my bubbly INFP-affection self, and she'll say things like ""I hate a lot of people, but I could never hate you."" And I know it means she loves me, and I know it means she loves me when she makes me a special note for my birthday even though she acts like its not a big deal so I frame it. She keeps me grounded and isn't afraid to say ""Shush, stop rambling"" or ""that was a stupid joke"" which I appreciate. I feel like she can see right into me and likes me for it, not just likes me anyways."

ISTJ,"Rave: My sister's dog isn't dead which is nice. Totally had a type 6 moment while out shopping.

But she was alive, though I did find an empty carton that a chicken pot pie had been in in the middle of the floor. It really irritates me how it's my sister's bratty dog and she's the one that doesn't push her chair in ever! That's how the dog gets on the table in the first place."
INTP,"I don't think humans can grasp the concept of ""nothing"" because we are used to substituting something for something else and calling it nothing. Nothing, really, is the absence of anything. Nothing has no color, no shape, no size, no texture. Nothing simply does not exist."

Some people have described ENFP's as controlling. In a way, I am controlling them by spoon-feeding them pieces of me. Yet, that is not the objective. I do, however, test people as a way to protect myself from dealing with the type of Fe I hate. That is only if I can not 'grade' a person via observation. Once I finally trust you, you will probably feel like, ""meh"". As my brother likes to say, ""Get over yourself.""    Heh, it's not about them, is it?

A bit surreal, that feeling/wondering, haha. The other one was due to having a friend picking on me really bad and unfairly out of the blue, I didn't want to show anything to anyone, though, so that wasn't really a tantrum in this sense, just raging silently by going out and exerting myself physically to release it somehow.

ISTJ,"I'll cop to being very liberal, as I'm not embarrassed by the term. I think equality is not a gray area. Certain industries are dominated by certain groups out of tradition and habit, and that's fine, as long as nobody else wants in. It's when someone wants in who has earned that but is not given it that there's a problem. This goes for flight attendants, bank clerks, and liquor stores alike. If I walk into a bank near here and every staff member is an asian female, I'd find that peculiar, because that doesn't even come close to reflecting the makeup of my area. But it's certainly possible that this is just how it turned out, and the only qualified personnel who applied and were hired happened to be asian and female. I personally wouldn't make a big deal out of it, but I would certainly hope if someone more qualified failed to get a job there, they would do something about it.   "
ENFP,"I don't care about a mate's money position - both of my longest-terms have been from the ""lower"" classes, while my Mom's family was nouveau riche and my Dad's poor but colorful (he was kind of in the mold of Don Draper in ""Mad Men"") - but people from ""higher"" classes are sometimes better about money because they've had it and they're used to how it works. There's no guarantees, though: there can also be children of ""higher"" class families who feel entitled. It depends on the individuals. For myself I found more vitality among ""lower"" class background grrls who were adept enough to move in ""high"" circles."

ISTP,"It makes sense that evolution would favor physically healthy people as opposed to intellect, what i don't understand is why we pull the weak an useless up instead of allowing them to fall.

INFJ,"Just makes me wonder why actual teenagers aren't hired to play teenagers?  I mean, even a 19 or 20 yr old is more believable as a 17 yr old than a 27 yr old is.  Aren't there enough teenage actors to cast a series?  I really don't get it.  "
ENFJ,"I'm so weird.  I just found out that Temple Grandin will be a commencement speaker at the university I work at and that she's receiving an honorary degree, and I literally started to tear up.

ENFP,"Raw Honey also has been shown in several scientific studies to have great antiviral and antibiotic effects. Also probiotics, such as Sacchramyoces boulardii as found in products like Florastor (I have no stock in the company) have been shown in studies according to the American Academy of Family Practitioners  to decrease the length of viral illnesses even upper respiratory illnesses."
ENTP,"I'm xNTP, currently hovering in a weird state between introverted and extroverted. I developed stronger tendencies towards the latter over the past year."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by ninjahitsawall   I guess? I don't know, it happens automatically. Once I feel obligated to do something, I become resistant to it. The Fe-type stuff is largely to do with etiquette, my speech being corrected/censored because of semantic BS, etc. So I usually try to avoid people once they've shown themselves to be like that, rather than altering my behavior to fit in their Manners Box. It seems like the healthiest option.. Never seems like there's something I could say that wouldn't make the situation worse. From my perspective, people who nitpick you like that seem emotionally unstable, and it's like the more direct you are with them, the more it seems to backfire. Especially when they are trying to be ""helpful"" and then when you don't accept their help they get all offended. lol."
ENTJ,"This is something I've been curious about for a while and my ENTJ SO hasn't really given me a satisfying answer, so I thought I'd throw it out here:"
ISTJ,"Do any other (female... ?!) ISTJs like musicals? Or am I just crazy insane over here, in my own little corner?! Yeah, it's probably just me. *sigh*    I've also seen the 1965 Lesley Ann Warren version of Cinderella and the Julie Andrews version done on Broadway (one of the stage productions was filmed). I think Brandy did a better job than Lesley Ann Warren but I remember being impressed by Julie Andrews. Though she is Julie Andrews. "
INFP,Sometimes I wish I was a INFJ instead of an INFP because I can atleast act the same but without the procrastination because I STILL haven't turn in my college applications.
ESTP,"@Sygma  - nope, no ring. Didn't have one in my last marriage either, wait where was I going with that... Throws self off bridge    The underlined and bolded.  You have never lived together or see each other, why would you marry someone that you have no clue of day to day habits/quirks.  Also, how does he interact with your child?"
ENTP,Originally Posted by Hanne   so why would anyone put diamonds on the soles of her shoes?    to cut glass.
INTP,"Scientists ain't doing their jobs right, man. Food sustains me, but no one is worrying about that.    Food printer."
ESFJ,"For instance, this week I noticed it was one of my kids' teachers birthday (via Facebook) and wished her a happy birthday that morning and my daughter decided on her own accord she wanted to make her a card. The teacher was really surprised and touched to read it and that someone would remember. I also wrote a friend (outer circles / acquaintance) of mine in town who is nearing the end of her pregnancy and told her I know how crazy it is at the end to find care for your other kids while you go into labor and I could definitely watch hers for her if she wants (our kids are in the same class etc). She was so relieved because she has no family in town and didn't know what else she would do. She never asked me or hinted on it but I just knew this would be a nice thing to help someone out. Or the other day in passing I told someone I know that I read his article he wrote for the student paper and thought it was wonderful and his face lit up and he was excited it reached other people and meant something to them. Just a few examples, but you get the point. "
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Sela   At least you don't have to worry about that being type-specific.  I had these great plans to go to the rec center which is literally four blocks from my office once it warmed up a little; I'd have to get up an hour earlier and I just cannot motivate myself to get up at 5am.    It all starts with awesome ideas in our head with goals to reach and mile markers... then nothing! However, I have been focusing on eating healthy and watching my portions. What I was going for was a life style change. Is that something you were shooting for as well? What goals did you have in mind for exercising?"

ENTP,"I already know that ENTPs love me, so I guess there is no need for me to ask.   "
ESTJ,"Anyways for me, they're not Spanish at all. They're white.    Probably because I'm exhausted from work. That and the fact that Visigoth makes me think of a cross between this:"

ESFJ,Not sure why ESFJ guys/girls could be so different to you.  Maybe you are jealous of ESFJ guys?  ;-P
ENTP,"Hey @WishUKnew come back! I really apologize, I have no right to answer sarcastically to your public questions on the sarcastic answer thread. I totally deserved to be treated like shit, that was really the most mentally healthy decision you could make! I also think it is important that us ENTP peasants learn to swear less if we want to be respected by the bourgeois who are so civilized and superior and know the best manners to steal politely the lower classes and that's why they're so rich and deserve it."
INTJ,"I would not call what you did teasing to be honest... Annoying more like. We're not doing this to persuade you, you person with things."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by ENTJGirlLA   I can see how an ESTP would find INTxs pretentious, but why would they perceive ENTJs and ENTPs as such? And do you think it is the same for ISTPs?

ENFP,ENFPs:  Would you be upset if your closest introverted friend called you an attention whore?
INTJ,"I wish we could just talk.  Cos couched in generalities, as is proper, I'm getting (Ne) that you're avoiding some problem between personal values and a puzzling situation ""out there"" and just solving little problems ""out there"" (the video game) isn't cutting it.  "
ISFJ,"Also you can't stand to gossip, but when you do you feel incredibly guilty about it."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Jumbotool   What do you admire most in your close friends?    I'm with BigJake on loyalty.  It is the #1 thing I treasure most in friends, and I reciprocate it.  In fact, one thing that will put a person on my ""no second chance"" list is a major betrayal (either in friendship or in romance).  So I'd have to say loyalty, trust and steadfastness are on the top of my list."
ISFJ,"but at the same time, its because i dont want to break a promise, because i do pride myself in keeping to my word (except for a few small things that i forgot about, and one issue with an online stalker (incidentally, i actually let that go on a few years because of my promise))"
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by perpetuallyreticent   Do you guys find it easy or hard to hold grudges/stay mad at people? Even if they deserve it. I think one of my close friends might be an ISFJ (her Fe is astounding) and she has a really, really hard time staying mad at people. She's 18, so she's very young but I've noticed with her she doesn't hang onto the past. I really don't know if she's an ISFJ for sure.    I do not hold grudges, nor do I get mad at people very often. most of the time is because my friends actually do not make me mad. I am quite accepting, and most of what people do does not affect me. I am only strict on myself, rarely strict on others. But i do not like people being consistant late, i think thats the only thing that gets me annoyed. then again I only have really great people as friends, so maybe thats why lol. xD"
ISTP,"We talked today. I'll give her some time and will get back to her on Sunday. Then I could ask how was her weekend, things like that. Calling her up too much will make me appear needy and attractiveness could be lost."

INFJ,All I did was take what everyone else was suggesting and turn it into a grammatically correct sentence.
ENTJ,Originally Posted by purplelirpa   How do you track your goals? Do you use tools like vision boards or dream boards? It seems like a lot of the ENTJs I've known are very visual when it comes to using methods to describe their insights and then implementing them.
INFJ,"Also interested to see if I keep my current post or if Sam decides to release me.  I'm thinking... no.  If I'm back there, he can get away from me...  It's Tuesday... beware the leprechuans.  Yes DQ... it is an odd little traditon we've concocted, that is for certain.  Cheers!  "

ENFJ,"Well, in seriousness, if your friends do not like physical contact, respect that. But that doesn't mean it's impossible to get some contact from them. Like, try to find an excuse to hug or even pat on their shoulders, to encourage, confort or congratulate them. Don't be overly physical, but small contacts can be confortable, particularly if your friends enjoy it once for a while, it means they appreciate it even though they aren't much into it. "

ENFJ,I've been at work 15 minutes and already the day is declining.  Someone didn't communicate the right msg with me last week and now it has reflected badly on my work.  I'm going to become miss anal-retentive to that person from now on and make sure he doesn't affect my job negatively again.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by aLamour   What is your opinion about mainstream, society, and popularity?    I won't hate something because it is mainstream and I won't like something because it is mainstream. Whether or not something is mainstream will not interfere with my enjoyment of it. I know what I like and I can tell someone why I like it so, if they're going to go ragging on me for liking/disliking something that is mainstream, I can back up my decision. "
ISTP,"Originally Posted by Earworms   It's not the children's fault, it's the parents. Bad children come from bad parents (usually). Don't forget that you were a child once. People shouldn't hate children, they will grow up one day and end up being haters too!    Oh I know that and most of my anger is directed towards the parents to be honest. And I hate people in general, so meh. Little ants living their truly insignificant lives, thus is the nature of existence. No one is special nor deserves to be treated as such, blahblahblah."
ENTJ,"I am personally always up for educating people on how stupid they sound when they refuse to see beyond their own perspective of a situation.... Now, if I could only cash in on this mostly futile expenditure of my time I would likely find the process more enjoyable."
ESTP,"I have a question. Why do INTJs have such a hard time getting along with ESTPs? From my end, you all can be compelling and immensely likable. However, you can also be unpredictable in a way that is difficult to gauge. To someone whose first step in dealing with someone else is predicting their actions, this can be hard to deal with."
ISFP,"Originally Posted by TheLuckyOne   I hate myself for being all talk and no action. I mean, don't get me wrong...I practice what I preach; I live simply, I don't ever get anything new, and own less and less things with each passing day, but I never accomplish anything, and I feel like I'm rotting away here. I have all these big stupid dreams I know I'll never accomplish. I want to start a revolution and change the world, but I haven't even managed to abandon my job yet, and I'm just as big of a sucker for security as the next guy/girl/it/genderfucked person."

Oddly enough, my first instinct is usually right but then I attempt to overthink it. Of course, it could be that I really am stupid. That is always an option, too, lol.    From my experience I believe its possible for two people to reach the same conclusion even if they are going by it in different ways. One may trust their logic and others their feelings, with equal results. When I use my logic I can reach certain principles or see a pattern, but when you would use your feelings you can determine based on a value system what is right or wrong. There often coincide! "

ESFP,"I've felt the same way around Ti dominant personalities.    This is right on the money... And I'll admit, I sometimes take what he'll say too seriously. What I mean by ""rile up"" is he'll either playfully insult me, compliment himself incessantly, LITERALLY poke and prod, and purposefully do things that he knows are my triggers (all in good fun of course -_-). This is how most of our hangouts start and sometimes it makes me retreat further into myself. Sometimes I just want him to talk to me normally! I know he's just playing, but it's really hard to tell him I'm not in the mood because I get the sense he thinks I'm being over dramatic and too sensitive (which I'll admit, I have a tendency to do...). In short, he can really get under my skin... I love him to death, but sometimes he's poking a ticking time bomb"

ESFP,"She said ""awwwww"", which is her equivalent of LALALA NOT LISTENING (or: While that's all very interesting, let's not talk about this anymore...) and my face just about hit the keyboard. I don't think I've met a person more receptive to criticism to the extent I actually felt bad for it. She made an INTJ feel bad. That just doesn't happen everyday. When she asked me to critique her college essay, I was brutal: ""Don't say it this way. You don't have a distinct voice. Colleges don't care about the technical details of your research in an essay about intellectual exploration."" ""Did you read the second paragraph?"" ""Honestly, I couldn't get to it. I got lost somewhere between the first sentence and all the medical jargon you threw in there"". As always, she doesn't like to disagree with criticism even though sometimes I might have gone overboard."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by dogshavesillynames   Has anyone dated both an INFJ and something more similar to your own type? I would love to hear experiences from someone who dated both an INFJ and an ISt/fJ, for example.    I married an infj, a few years ago I would've said the second most serious gal I dated was also infj. Now that I've learned more about mbti, I believe she may have been as isfj. While much of the differences between the two may have to do with up bringing, family, and personal preference/beliefs, here is the basic differences between the two."
ESTP,* Likes people but does not devote herself to serving them like ESFJ's

If i am attracted by someone and i notice a feeling but don't want to commit i'm honest and tell them that i don't want a serious/long lasting relation. Chances are they are good with it. If they don't at least you tried and they know how you feel towards them. I can only talk for me of course.

I think of it this way: I try to live my life as positively as possible. I help people, I try to educate our youth, I help the elderly, and I try to be a good member of society. And that comes from me, because I feel it's right. If there is a God, and IF he's as forgiving as everyone says s/he is, then I'm confident that s/he will forgive me for living my life exactly how s/he told me to, minus worship.

Probably won't be as long as there are places to hang out and your school isn't crowded like mine. Then again, cliques in some way, shape, or form are inevitable in life.

Honestly people, life's tough, are you seriously complaining about something that minor? And when I say minor, I mean really minor. Like, the event inconvenienced them for 20 minutes max most of the time. And what really pisses me off is that what caused the inconvenience for them is usually a greater and longer convenience to other people. But since they don't receive these conveniences, the personal inconvenience is all that matters to them and (in their head) everyone around them!"

I remember happy moments, but they can't be worth what I'm going through now."" I feel whiny when I'm like this. But I also feel like it's not my fault, and I can't do anything about it. Emotions are uncontrollable for me. For me, they have nothing to do with external, controllable things.

But I can't continue to worry about being someone or something that I'm not for people who otherwise wouldn't accept me. If I'm not able to remain on one group's wavelength without an extraordinary amount of effort, that's their problem, and not mine!"

I told him sorry, I couldn't be with him because I needed to feel something to be with someone and that I had never really felt anything for anyone.

To me, I see that as intent to kill.    Yea, first one was a box cutter she had picked up from a workbench (we were in a garage). Second one... I think was a knife? May have been a broken bottle or something. I was REALLY drunk. Just know that after the cops showed up, I wasn't arrested because all the witnesses said it was justifiable self-defense. Third one was... confusing. Turned out later, that she was joking around with a butter knife in her hand and had tripped or something (not as in joking about stabbing me with a butter knife, but doing something and just had the knife in her hand by coincidence).

I think the misconception comes for the fact that we are also very active offline. We lead busy lives! But I like people so I find it super interesting to learn more about them. "

ISFJ,"- When you notice and appreciate people doing the invisible, yet practical and essential job (such as cleaners, electricians...) and think you want to be one of them some day because of that. [Or, maybe I just was an exceptionally dull nine-year-old planning her life...]"
ENFJ,"Usually I wouldn't even speak about my problems as problems - because my problems are really insignificant to me sometimes. I speak of them to involve people, but not to seek their sympathy. "
ISFP,"How would you react if someone told you directly that they want to be your friend, and bought you a cake or invited to the cinema ?Awesome. I would totally go to a movie with someone."
ISFP,"-Fun to be around, bubbly, a bit intrusive at times. Have endless energy to talk XD Genuinely nice. "

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by nosilla   I think they go hand in hand... when you hear ""Ikea,"" you think low prices and durable furniture.    It's a crapshoot whether IKEA furniture will be good or not. I have a dresser from IKEA which falls apart if I try to move it, and the bottoms of the drawers can't support even a moderate amount of weight without falling out. I have a standing pantry in my kitchen from IKEA with a cracked shelf, because it couldn't support the weight of canned goods. It also has one crooked leg because the bottom panel was drilled incorrectly while manufacturing. Still, I have a great TV stand/cabinet from IKEA, though one of the doors doesn't hang straight because of a manufacturing defect in one of the hinges. Hardly noticeable."
ISTJ,"@hello317 :  The TP Triangle is where you take one long sheet of TP and put it on the back of the seat.  Then you take another long sheet of TP and put it on one side of the seat.  You do the same thing on the opposite side with another long sheet of TP.  This is how I always did it, old-school style, before toilet seat covers became common.  Some places don't have the covers, so I do the TP Triangle."

ENFP,"Sometimes I wish I was not so needy, but I hate being alone. "
ISFJ,"Oh, and you also can't tell them how you feel, because it might inconvenience them or hurt their feelings. Plus, Ti is questioning whether you have any right at all to FEEL the way you do."
ESFJ,"You're an ESFJ, when your chat looks like this: ""Bla bla bla ... Oh btw, did you hear from X [just a random guy we see a few times per week at work]? He didn't call me today. Actually he didn't write any emails since yesterday. He's not at work today. I asked the boss, she said he will come but he didn't. That's so not like him. I think something's wrong.

ENFJ,XD    Please don't! IMHO you keep it going! You can't retire...I won't allow it ;)
ENFP,"Do you think she's an ENFP?    I don't know. She seems to jump from subject to subject and talk with her hands like an ENFP but her voice and the way she says words don't seem like an ENFP. The thing she talked about not being able to restrain herself doesn't work for me, I lose track of time, but I have restrains for myself especially for food otherwise I would be a ball."
INTP,"The teacher at this little arts and crafts course I went to today was talking a lot. She seemed very energized by all the talking she was doing with her students. I wonder how she feels like when she is alone and with no one to talk to. She seems like a very extroverted person. Maybe she feels a little bored. Which is curious, because I feel either bored or over-stimulated when I'm around too many people, and active when I'm by myself or around close friends. Another interesting observation on human personalities..."
ENTJ,"I just know what has to go in and out. I think Ni gives me a sense of what to do, and Te makes it easy to perform. Occasionally Ni will give me a funny feeling about something, so I'll hesitate and look at other options. It's usually telling me that there's something I've missed, or a better opportunity I've overlooked and if I sleep on it I can usually figure it out.    I wonder if brainstorming is a Ne-thing. I have a hard time with lists, they never seem to be comprehensive enough and I always feel like I'm missing something with only one layer."
ISFP,"3.Then I'll regret and get depressed and feel nobody understands me, because I don't speak up my feelings.    "

ISTP,"I'm in a relationship with an ESFJ and things are truly great. Best relationship of my life, most loving man I've ever encountered. But whenever we spend time apart my Ni becomes like that snake from Jungle Book, whispering venomous insinuations and ""seeing"" the worst possibilities for the relationship. "
ENFP,I don't know many ENFPs besides myself... Is there a lot of drama when more than one ENFP is together or does it just depend on the people?    Lol. I work with an actual Dr. Cox. The other interns are afraid of him. I simply adore him as a teacher. Sometimes I think my life at work is like a Scrubs sitcom.
ENTP,"-raskoolz    Here's my question: You're part of a clan in 2015?  Also, this is an easy one.  You know your pillow is obviously alive, right.

Then, once you earn its trust (assuming it follows the same social rules as humans), get it on camera, show your evidence to the world and become rich."
ISTJ,"I am so glad it works this way. I don't have a decent job either and while I know my parents won't mind paying for me, I would rather not be a financial burden on someone and rely on their goodwill. Rather be independent and pay back when I am capable. I guess that was a rave...."
ESFJ,This explains why there aren't many ESFJ members and related threads on this forum.
ISFJ,Also what do you want in your ideal partner? How you feel loved? How do you love? How can I understand if you're serious or not? I'm lost.

INTJ,"Originally Posted by antiant   Things don't have to make sense to you, it makes sense to him and you can't force him to make any sense, so really just leave it alone. Also, if you keep pestering an 'INTJ' like that, they are going to resent you and hate you even more. It's clear that he needs his space/time to himself and he's doing just that, so move on. If he reconsiders, he'll reconsider, right now he's taking a break and doesn't want to be bothered.    All right then. Just for the record, I only asked him about it twice, and I'll probably not do so again, which is why I'm here, because I want more insight on the matter."

ENTJ,"How are you likely to interact with a member of a friendship group who you don't like or respect AS MUCH as the others?

ISTP,"Originally Posted by cursive   Also, people typically only share their highlights. No point comparing yourself to someone else's highlight reel.    Yeah, most people, unless they're narcissistic and self-absorbed and share everything (including mentioning when they go to the grocery store), will only share the good stuff. The thing is, though, that you shouldn't compare yourself to other people's metric, rather your own."
INFJ,We need a VIP lounge on PerC where all the VIP members can hang out and be cool together
ESTJ,I don't agree.  I've witnessed many times an ESTJ not expressing their true anger towards something to save their image.  ESTJs really care about what the public thinks of them in what I've noticed.  However; when they're around their family or significant others they let loose and can become very temperamental and abusive.

I ... no, just no."
ESFJ,"Who notices all these ""small details""?    For one, we notice. Haha! But that aside, yes I do think it's important to us. I think it is what makes our world a kinder place. It's one way to show you care about people by doing small things for them. It's like life drums on at a basic level of busyness and anonymity but when somebody else on their own accord does some small act of kindness or remembers a small detail about you, it can really turn someone's day for the better. I think it makes people feel like they matter and are noticed and not just swimming in a sea of people and work and jobs and busy life, you know? Like it brings a little humanity back."
ENFP,Originally Posted by devoid   That's really sweet. It reminds me a bit of the first time I truly fell in love.    This is not the first time I have this kind of feeling for someone. I tent to get close and to love people who need me in way but don't say it out loud.

ISTJ,Originally Posted by zeth006   What about the other ISTJ you were interested in?    I am just trying not to think about him. I still don't know what to think about that situation and I can't risk getting in trouble for asking him. I don't want to move on if I shouldn't but I don't want to throw my fertile years away if I shouldn't either.
ESFP,"Ty. You are very helpful. He said it like it was the past. Heh. And I have no idea what cool and awesome are supposed to mean. They are so vague I can't wrap my brain around them, but no guy has really been able to describe how they felt about me clearly (not ESFPs or ENFPs). Heh. I don't think he'd ever ask for space directly, but passive aggressively perhaps? I just don't want to annoy him.  Hmm. Well, I tend to over-react perhaps with the enneagram 4, but 2 of my exes have used foul language at me when they were angry. Perhaps I have nothing to worry about, but he is somewhat like the 2 others. Just seemingly sweeter and rambles more. Heh. I just don't know if I actually mean much or anything to him, and if I don't, then I don't want to entertain it. I also want to make sure it's not just sexually, and I don't know what all to do about that. He brings out a great side in me and in himself. He's so relaxed and funny. I don't know how to cut things off if I feel they need to be, and I have no idea how to ask politely w/o offending him if he's seeing me because he's bored. He gets somewhat easily offended and I don't want to attack his character. I've been guilty of/done the same."
ISFJ,"There's also quite a lot more that can be accomplished off screen. Virtual worlds lack that kind of satisfaction. People can get lost in the abstract and lose touch with what's going on in the lives of the people whom they care about in their immediate, tangible world. I do it way too much as an enneagram type 5, so I have to remind myself that my relatives have very real and immediate needs, they want someone to talk with, someone to listen to them, someone to be with them, someone to laugh with. I typically can enjoy myself and the benefit is mutual. Active presence in other people's lives is important."
ENTP,"2(the crazy one): There is an infinite amount of realities, and every little thing you do like twitching your finger creates a new reality just like you explained. So when you ""time travel"", you don't create a new reality, you just travel to a different reality, because one of those realities in the infinite amount of realities is actually the ""past"" but in the ""present""."
ENFP,"I seem to have quite some drama with my F friends (INFJs & INFPs) lately. They can be great friends and be on the same wave lenght as me but sometimes their F is too much drama and annoys me. I never ever had this problem with my INTP, ESTJ, ENTP and ESTP friends. So I'm thinking it must be the T that prevents them from going all drama about small things. They are also okay with not being in contact for a while and then when we see each other, it's as great as ever. They never reproach to you that you're not staying in contact enough or that you take two dayd to reply to texts sometimes."
ENFJ,"My adrenaline is pumping, my ears are starting to burn, my head is about to explode, my skin is tingling with rage, my BP is rising --- I feel pain and helplessness and a rage that I cannot control. "

INTP,"Also, this of course assuming you can smell at all... Luckily I can. I seem to have a hypersensitive smell."
ESFJ,"3) Yeah, you can't just wave a logic flag all the time. Other types of intellects will have sensing and/or feeling in their personality types. Pure logic and pure emotion do not mix well and other contradict the other. Also, pure emotion and pure logic by themselves aren't efficient. One must learn to have a balanced ratio of both to be a well rounded, enlightened person. The struggle for us INTP's and possibly for other intellect types is that we need to learn to incorporate emotion into our decision making because we lack the understanding of it. It takes time and experience for the maturation and learning to occur. Life becomes much more enjoyable and easier once one learns this concept and improves at it. "

ENFP,"I am very slow to trust people, I am terrified of intimacy. In the past, I have opened myself to someone only to have them tell me they did not care, to tell me that they did not feel the same way, and I have a very hard time trusting someone like this. I think that she opened me up, she saw through my pain, through my face, and that really scares me. We went on the date, I liked her a lot. Very talkative, bubbly, interesting. She's athletic, she's attractive, she's sure of herself. I like that a lot. She asked me a lot of questions, some of them were too personal and I told her I did not want to answer and I changed the subject. I would move around the questions, I would ask her questions instead. I told her I was uncomfortable with this and that, and she didn't like that. She told me, afterwards, that I was a different person than I was on Saturday night, that I wasn't as open, and it made her hesitant. I felt awful, I felt like I got rejected, so I brooded a bit and then I called her and left her a message explaining that I am afraid of intimacy, that I am afraid of opening myself. How should I treat this person? Should I be as direct as I would be if I were dealing with myself? How would you ENFP females (or males) see this situation?    Well, I don't really know an ENFP who doesn't care and she'll probably probe you until you start having a positive aura/outlook/feel-to-you and I would suggest not avoiding the questions because even if she doesn't keep bringing it up, it'll probably be constantly on her mind."
INTJ,"I had a question, but, I believe that it would make an interesting thread of its own."
ISTJ,"I think certain things sound sexy and exciting when in reality, they  just aren't.  Some people have to fumble their way through the  potentially sexy/exciting things to figure out that they aren't, while  some people know themselves well enough to be able to skip through much  of the drama."
ENTJ,"Well, that's about it. If maust would like to add anything I hope she certainly does, otherwise good luck but know an ENTJ/ENTP relationship will be difficult once the initial infatuation wears off."

ESFP,"You're clearly an Fe user, but not Fe dominant. When we; as human being; describe people, we say what is note worthy or considered unusual by the describer. Many introverts will note that extroverts are talkative, friendly. Many extroverts will note when people are quiet, shy. Now what you said was, ""He's extremely social and wants to talk to everyone, even if he doesn't know what to say. Introverts typically need to pause, think, then speak. even if it's just for a second. So they naturally pretty bad verbal improvisers. They like to prepare speeches. Extroverts will just wing it. You stating this means that you consider this unusual. Picture an ESFJ, or ENFJ saying that. HELL NO! The Fe is STRONG!

And I wasn't really excited about the relationship, I was leaning more towards being there as a friend. "

I just finished a degree in Physics, but I got bored with that about 1/3 of the way through and now I want to move on to something else.  Also at the moment I play the piano, spend a lot of time researching various psychology and philosophy topics, and read books on almost everything.  My interests can last anywhere from a week to a couple of years, and I do sometimes go back to them, but at some point I invariably get bored and move on.  I enjoyed school because learning about 12 different subjects at once held my interest.  Now that I have to specialise I find it much more difficult to stay on task."
INFP,People with a loose grip on reality shouldn't be allowed to indulge in ideas of the fantastic.

INFP,"Nevertheless, it's good that you have a high range of empathy  Not everyone shares such compassion.    I think deep down I trust people who are vulnerable. I see them as honest and with something to offer. When I see someone who appears to be perfect I find it hard to see the depth in their soul. But if someone has some kind of fragility or problem then the depth is obvious. I also think it's just generally good to help people who need it.

I feel that living on one's own for a long period of time is not really as ideal as you make it out to be when you get around to the actual thing. But I guess if you have friends and a support network in your area, then its o.k. "
ISFJ,"I love you guys though, you guys are the kindest and warmest people I've known and could be rather goofy once you get close with one. I was raised by one. XD    sucks right? xD but what do you mean by mood swing? can u give an example?"
INFP,I really don't like being a pawn in emotional manipulation between women at college. Don't take advantage of my friendliness and mysterious nature. I don't like it because it helps people judge premature situations that are already fragile between myself and a group of people. Social manipulation

They just won't be able to get anything out of me on that topic until I feel it's reached an appropriate level of fermentation and is palatable (to me).

ESFJ,It is your ego they prioritize. Sure for their own reason yet still... Prove me wrong.
ESTP,An ideal friend says hello. Does not avoid you in the halls. Doesn't exclude you just because they're on a higher social rank. Doesn't tell everyone you had sex.

ESTJ,"Hmm, I never had a problem with this, so I'm not able to use any personal experience. "
ISTJ,Oh no. Each type inspires me for their different approaches to situations. INTPs and INTJs very much like ISTJs tend to have a strong sense of logic. INTJs are the perfect legal scholars and are good at improvisation from what I've seen and read. My situation is calling for me to think outside the box and beyond the conventional rules.
INFP,"I hate this process of truly getting to know the world without rose tinted glasses on. This gradual loss of ideals and innocence is so heartbreaking. And it is abhorrent to me, that other people could have the nerve to attempt to cut you down for caring. Because... well fuck. Maybe you learned early on what life is really like, and it didn't hurt because you don't care. Well I fucking care, and it's not wasted energy. Because I at least treat the people around me with a bit of dignity."
INTJ,"Now that I've looked at this a little more in depth, I can see that my technique differs depending on whether there is an aspect or party to the situation that is outside of my control. When it is entirely or mostly my deal, I work fast. If there's a chance I will have to depend on something else to come to a conclusion then I have trained myself to be comfortable with the slower pace. As you both have mentioned, the torture otherwise is not worth it."
ESFP,"Originally Posted by Memory Of Talon   Its difficult for me to give you advice from the male side of things as I understand there are sexual differences in strategies and so I don't want to lead you astray or get your hopes up. If you really want to know I would be direct and ask, but I wouldn't do so until you've backed off and let him initiate a few times to make sure he has interest in you. You might ask the sex and relationship forum as this has less to do with personality and more to do with human relationships. as an ESFP I look for clear signals of interest and then I tend to take the direct approach.    Thank you!"
ENTJ,"Me:  Natural?  So is cholera and Ebola.  I am looking for a natural-appearing result, I could care less if the ingredients to get it are found in nature."

ENFP,"Are you guys generally hard to get ahold of? I know three ENFPs and it seems to me that I will never communicate with them unless it was their idea first. Texts, Facebook chats, and phone calls go unresponded to, but weeks (or months) later, they'll randomly text me just to say ""hey."" Do you guys have any issues with communication? :P"
ENTP, But also I've been called 3 and 5 quite a lot as well. 
INTJ,"Eg. One  even convinced a few unsuspecting NFs and STJs that mass genocide of people from a certain background is absolutely necessary for the progress of humanity.    Don't think that's an INTJ thing, it just sounds like your friend is a horrible person. Sorry about that, but hey it happens. :/"
INFP,"I am dead. I've been dead for a long time, it seems. The world leers at me. How can I smile? It took from me when I was young, made me want to hide myself forever because it was unspeakable. I wanted to die so badly. The word 'shame' was one I couldn't ever speak, I still find it hard, it means so much. I can't cope with the intensity. If I see a flicker of love in someone's eyes, it makes me want to run away. Sometimes I can't breathe. But I hold my head up and laugh, waiting to turn around the next corner to a place where things are better, where people might not hate me. But this path just carries on, there is no end and I am still the same, but I am becoming more ugly, more evil, more repulsive, more selfish, I can't show myself, there are things I have to push to the side and hide so no-one will find out. They'd be disgusted. I can't help but think I must have lost myself somewhere on the way of forgetting. Three layers of fakeness, hollow inside. But I know I haven't really forgotten. I can't escape from myself. I want to bleed, but that would be giving in, and I'm scared it'll go further. I'm so selfish to have written all this about myself. "

ENFP,"These are all personal things that describe me...a little, and can't begin to paint the picture of who I am...nor will any answer paint a picture of all ENFPs....we all are similar in they way we process things, but the things which we choose to process and the ways in which we express ourselves and our feelings in relation to those things will change.

ENFJ,I hate being around volatile situations at home or anywhere else for that matter. Someone else's anger on another person when unjustified pulls me into a fit of unbelievable rage myself. I have to really suppress my desire to get involved. The whole drama leaves me completely drained after it happens. 
ENFJ,"I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone have any input on how to work with my emotions and not against them to make it through the day?"
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Blue Ocean   I watched Schindler's List yesterday for the first time. It's pretty rare that a film makes me want to cry (ignoring my teenage years when I was an emotional mess), but this one did. Very un-INTJ I know but anyone else felt like crying, or very upset, after a film? Anyone actually cried?    I remember crying at the Boy in the Striped Pajamas. This film, Schindler's List and the LOTR trilogy (and especially the scene at the end of the 3rd one) are the only 3 films to have made me cry. Titanic just bored me to tears. That doesnt count though, right? =P"

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ThoughtShadows   Posting anonymously helps. I can't really open up to people about my feelings on things in real life. I don't think they would understand. I am tired by social obligations, rules, procedures, duties, policies, blah, blah, blah. It is all smothering me and making me feel dead instead. I want to feel the love between people, genuine love. I want to feel deeply again and express it via art. My heart has been darkened and I've become bitter and cynical. I'm tired of being pushed around, with my needs not being met. This 24/7 world is killing me. I want more time to live, to be free.    That is the amazing thing about the internet. It makes it easy for everybody to express themselves anonymously and thus also allows them to be authentic in a place without consequence.

Unless the guy figures out ways to please her, he's going to have to learn how to meet her new expectations.

Or maybe she is just acting is general-I don't know, but it doesn't fly with me.To be honest, I'm worrying far more about her than she is me and that's what pisses me off even more. She will come up to me and ask me how I'm doing while obviously I'm busting my ass. Then after I offer a look of exasperation, she will say ""ok, cool, I'm going to get my nails done, Call me on my cell if you need me"". I am seriously trying to get through it, it's not a personal attack against her, it's just, I interpret it as inconsiderate and I find myself complaining more than I need to.

Also, if all functions were carried out in both hemispheres, the size  of the brain and its energy consumption would increase, which is not  affordable.

ESTJ,"The bluntness has always made me laugh; I like it when people are blunt with me. I believe ESTJ's feel the only way forwards into true progression (of course, this is how THEY personally perceive what progression is) is to tell people the truth. This means, if you've pleased them, you will know. If you have good traits you will know. Naturally, this also counts for the opposite. ESTJ's in my experience don't like dysfunction. For everything to be in working order, an ESTJ will identify the problem, and hope the person has the initiative to sort it out! If the targeted individual is actually suffering or struggling with something, this may come across as insensitivity and bullying- but I feel that the original aim was to improve standards for everyone."

ESFP,"Originally Posted by hulia   Whatta guys think of your introverted cousins? Do you ESFPs like us ISFPs?    Oh yeah.  I'm borderline on the whole I/E thing anyway, so I'm right there with ya."
ISTP,"But worst of all are apologetic ""thank you""s. They say it in such a tone and with such a facial expression that means ""thank you so much for spending your superior time on an annoying, helpless, undeserving person such as me. I'm sorry for always needing you."" And instead of feeling good, I feel guilty and like I need to assure them that they are worthy of my help. Why do I need to make them feel better for a favor I did for them? It makes me not want to do anything for them ever again.    I prefer ""don't mention it"" to ""you're welcome"". It conveys the message better, imo.."
ISTP,"Hey doofus, you're not the center of my world. You are, rightly, the center of yours. But let's remember each is the star in her own movie here. Grab a cocktail and wait a second. You will not just DIE without my attention for two hours."
ENTJ,"Furthermore, I don't appreciate the lack of substance you bring to conversation. If you have a question, I'll let others answer. The unending useless questioning seems pointless to me but comes factory standard with you."
ISTP,"And they wouldn't even begin to realize how right they are.    Tried FB for about 6 months, reminded me why I never kept up with old friends in the first place.

ENFJ,"Are hurt, pain, ""getting owned"", and disorder are not just a part of love as the other gushy stuff involved?  How well was your communication with these individuals?  After all, we do have a hard time expressing our own feelings/needs because we often consume ourselves with other people's to the point of destroying functional relationships because of our loss of self-awareness.  Maybe if good communication is  established early on, it would be a bit easier?  The one thing that you must not do, though, is make love or a successful relationship operate like an if/then statement in computer programming:"
ISFJ,You try and go out more so that you don't waste so much time thinking at home.

ENTP,"For example, everyone told me that I should become an Infantry Officer in the Army (perceived as the most masculine by many).  Instead, I chose to become a Human Resources Officer (often perceived as the most feminine).  Of course, I don't allow that perception to dissuade me from doing what I need to do.  And regardless that I chose that profession, NO ONE is going to consider me feminine.  I think us 8s can do some pretty caring things but that's another topic altogether."
ESTJ,"They can't work smart because they don't have any smart ideas. Far from it, because ESTJ's believe in being very stupid as a way of life."

ISFP,"And maybe it's ridiculous, but sometimes for me, taking a decision whether to mingle with other people is as hard as life's decision XD"
INTJ,"People have learned to not communicate with me unless they need something, as if they want something, they'll find me wholly unavailable.    So you have given up on people as a whole but still enjoy romantic ideas on PerC? :3"

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Freelancepoliceman   Did you ever mistype yourselves as INTP?    I think it would be really hard to mix the two. I'm currently dating an ISFJ and we are essentially yin and yang. He get's really stressed when I'm in a ""just wing it"" mood. His Si will respond by kicking into overdrive, sticking like glue to it's comfort zones, overexerting itself in the face of the unknowable. He doesn't like when he can't predict the outcome of an event. BUT unlike an intuitive which they'd gladly dive in for experimental purposes, an Si user can become afraid and make excuses to avoid the activity altogether."

You want facts from me, but at the same time you can't provide them yourself. It have a pretty easily understandable purpose, helping me playing the game. Or you guys that smart so you couldn't think about it? I personally doesn't have personality type, i am a mix between ISFJ and ISFP. So, for me this system is completly broken and when you talk about it, you talk about pointless shit."

INFP,"I wish I could just stop thinking and talking about things and just DO them. Maybe you'll hold me in higher esteem if I actually stopped talking and started doing things. I mean, I know you don't think very lowly of me but I certainly think more highly of you than you do of me. "
ENTP,Originally Posted by Neverontime   What were you doing the last time you were 'caught'? 
INTJ,"No, that type of detachment (it's on borderline indifference) definitely a T thing. ; ) Introversion is more of a in-my-own-world detachment. Which sparks me to ask, how do you do that? Is it not just a mechanical answer and you actually do have your own biased opinions or is it just that the most 'proper' answer is the one you take as your opinion..? Sorry, I'm just guessing around here xD"
ENFP,"It requires a balance of being able to distance yourself, and connect at will."
ENFJ,"It's 3:00am ... But I'm going for a looong walk. And I really don't feel like coming back.    Eh, I know this feeling, it will definitely get better once you keep at distance all memories. You probably miss the feeling when it all went well and the need she was fulfiling (the need to not be alone, to have someone who gives attention), unfortunately relationships don't stay in this state, they evolve...into what, now that depends from one to another. You can't turn back the past, but you can definitely find someone in the future to make you feel like that again. (or maybe even better)"
INTJ,"I'm quite sure your referring to when I teasingly demanded a higher quality of insult for which to be used against me and my fellow INTJs, I don't see how that's that bad. Unless you're coming from the INTJ's perspective, but I know as a fact that the INTJs on this forum aren't ones to be swayed by an 'act like a...' thread.    Threads like that are stupid and not healthy to begin with, and for others to look at themselves in a mirror. Cos frankly, others are ultimately not like you are. To me, that thread was indeed a parody of the darkest element of other types, which is not truly what an INFP would be themselves. "

ENTJ,"Different example (for comparison's sake). INTP and I had 8 arguments about MBTI before we finally got to why he didn't like it. I took most of his preliminary concerns as ""I just don't understand the system or how it works"" and answered with ""I use it as a framework to understand people. It's a personal thing, not a scientific thing, and most of the tests don't work anyway."" Which made him angry because ""you're a super thoughtful person, and this whole MBTI thing seems not well thought out."" Because it was about something that I view as part of who I am- trying to understand people- I refused to stop using it. I thought he was trying to change how I think. "

For ten hours, I was able to fall asleep, I think those where the best ten hours of non-reality I can ever feel so far. Ultimately, I don't think I would ever find myself going on a binge or anything like that. I just think I'm starting to understand what it feels like to want to escape from reality. I just don't feel like I want to be me to be me right now. I can also understand I was able to pass off as a strong ""thinker"" before. I spent a year at home, there were times where I haven't smelled fresh air for months. I was disillusioned knowing that my friends didn't see me anymore, they moved on. I thought to myself then, ""friends come and go, everything does, but only I remain."" Just me and my thoughts. There was a time when I was fascinated with machinery. I admired their efficiency, I admired how they got the job done. I admired how their feelings didn't get in the way or inhibit them, they got the job done and that was important. I think to myself, ""maybe I should be a machine."" I wouldn't have to wast so much time on wastful thoughts. And if I ever did think, it would be about getting things done. Efficiency. No more shards of glass in my head. No more emptiness in what appears in its stead. No clutter, no void. Just for a moment, I want nothing. I fear it is almost time for me to go.    Escaping from reality is not as good as it seems. I've been doing that every day for the past two years, and I feel dead. I have deadened my feelings and emotions and thoughts to the point where even when I'm not escaping using a particular substance, I still am not alive. It's all a dream punctuated by moments of clarity. I've deadened my soul. "

Part of the problem is, as you described, that you feel like you didn't explain yourself well, you are misunderstood, etc. Trying too hard can lead to situations where you end up blowing up or stressing out. Fe is the expressing feeling function, and in my experience, sadly, it seems that Fe types don't really necessarily know what they are feeling, or don't understand their feelings until they speak them. The insecurity we have _when_ we speak, they have when they _don't_ speak. Weird, eh? Fi feelings are best expressed by us via actions, and not words. Fi-Ne types--XNFPs--love to use words, but not directly. They prefer more metaphorical speech or more abstract communication--conceptual. We prefer action--maybe art, maybe service, maybe something else with our hands, but not so much with words. Words are the ISFP's enemy. ;-)    "

But, I've been going through a long period of self-awareness and was struggling with depression for quite awhile, so when she said I was ""self-absorbed"" I just about lost it. He inability or unwillingness to understand that a depressed person needs to be self-absorbed in order to save themselves is the last straw for me. She is very dynamic and charismatic which has allowed me to miss that she's also selfish and shallow and that we really don't have much in common. We've done ok in person, but all we ever do is go out to eat. I'd like to do more interesting stuff, but she's not interested in much that I like and vice versa. Even the movies we occasionally watch when I'm at her house, although sometimes funny or suspenseful, are not the ones I would watch. Recently, during the whole self-absorbed exchange, I wrote her 4 VERY to pretty long e-mails trying to explain what I'd been going through and why that may have appeared self-absorbed, but that I don't think I'm a self-absorbed person by nature. She responded to one in depth, the other three she responded to with ""ok"", ""This is a conversation we need to have in person,"" and ""thanks for sharing."" I am totally done. I don't want or expect her to change, but I'm done wasting my time with someone that is so different and unable to empathize and with having to be the one to suppress who I am to be around her. Not worrying about feelings may be an ESTJ personality trait, but it's not ok with me and I'd guess other people to just trample on their feelings.    That was harsh of her to do that to you. She didn't seem to comprehend with your situation, not even one bit. "

I'm sorry, I was thinking. I've apologized before. You said it made you feel like that I didn't need or want to talk to you, that I had forgotten about you. I didn't understand. It's been quite sometime since we talked, since you've talked to me, and now I understand. I sometimes think you are trying to show me how you felt by doing this. And I understand now, and I wish you'd stop. I think...do you remember the last time we talked? How you kept calling me babe and even though I feel a sensation cross through my body when we talk, even though sometimes I shake because you make me so nervous, I hide it. When your bubbly voice that oozes tenderness said your goodnight, I responded in a simple, passive way. And I don't know whether to regret it because honestly I can't express my feelings for you knowing that this might all just be a waste. Not that I would ever deem you waste, just that, I can't. I just can't show you, or tell you how I feel...knowing that every moment with you is fleeting and unstable. I want to give you all the love in the world, but I just can't. And much as I won't let myself, you won't let me either.I care about you. A great deal. And when you finally call, after I haven't heard for you in days.

Once you realize this, you want other people to also feel about themselves the way you do. The whole dynamic changes... It stops being about sacrifice and hardship and will power, and becomes all about emotional authenticity, happiness, and peaceful accommodations. Love is truthfully feeling good, not faking it.

Life's up and downs are certainly amazing and not everything is black and white. I believe part of it is saying to treasure all the relationships you currently have and don't fully let go of them. Your friends do love you, even though we're busy with our own lives at this and the next moment in time. They also regard your opinions pretty highly, shows when they'll talk to you in their low and highs. I'm also pretty scared at this moment in time, but I know it will pass because I didn't allow it to condense and turn into anxiety like before. It's pretty amazing how calm I feel now after typing my thoughts down. Well we can only go forward and by focusing on the moment, by ourselves, my ENFJs, and together my other PersonalityCafe friends and all those reading this.    "

He later phoned my husband and apologised for letting it out.  I don't know if they have always felt this way but I have always bent over backwards to fit in with my husband's family and it hasn't been easy at times.  The worst part is I am wondering how much of the last 16 years have been genuine if any of it.  Part of me would like to hurt her back by spilling a secret I know about her husband, but that is counter-productive and I know it would be wrong.  FYI, every time her husband drinks and we are present at a party or bar with them, he comes onto me, and I mean fully comes onto me, telling me that he would love to sleep with me, then when I laugh and say he doesn't mean that, he reiterates that he would.  I have rebuffed him so many times it is not funny, and got really angry at him 4 years ago at a party at our house.  Since then he appears to have gotten the message and left me alone.  I have never said anything to my sister in law because I didn't want to hurt her.  I have heard that he has had one affair, though I can not be 100% sure of the truth of that.   In fact I wonder if she is aware of how he feels about me and that is why she doesn't like me.  ??"

Many ENTJs believe that respect and trust is earned, not given freely, everything must be proved and demonstrated, guilty until proven innocent. My theory is that our Fi sees ourselves as ""I"" and the rest of the world as ""not I"", to put this into more extremes, its kinda like me against the world.

ISTP,Originally Posted by ThatDamnFierySeagoat   I'm in a rut. So I'm trying to go to college again (INTJ suggested I pick up a trade and it sounds like something I might benefit from) but I'm so worried that the fact that I dropped out from a community college here in Chicago two years ago (due to high stress) will be used against me. Not to mention that the $278 that I owed the community college got written off.
ISFP,"So, for the ISFP, Fi-Se-Ni-Te--our inferior function is the first truly verbal function. And since it's our inferior, it is both the least-suited to expressing what matters most to us, and is simultaneously also in the worst position to do so. That leaves us preferring to simply say nothing. ;-) INFPs, have the ""benefit"" of having a very verbal Ne aux. function. While their Fi is still dominant, their Ne, being facile, is able to, in a rather indirect manner, express enough to impress their sentiments--to evoke, not describe, to champion, not direct, etc. It can be amazing the difference one letter makes. ;-)    Whoa, I didn't expect, that much of explanation.

But I finally realised that my MBTI type is never going to fully explain who I am or my values, so I stuck with the one that comes closest to a generalisation. I don't get drained by people (although I kind of hate most people), I'm way more heavy on Ne than Ti, and I tend to focus on things outside of myself the most."
ENFJ,"However, I don't believe there is a ""one formula fits all"" scientific approach to clinical psychology, especially when diagnosing people. The procedure for diagnosis is important, but it can also put the blinders on to other possible issues.    I completely agree, but that's what makes psychology so fascinating! It's an objective theory based on the subjective human element. It's a contradiction and a beautiful, hot mess."

The reason I was able to overcome it, was because I treated it like a regular discussion, and constantly reminded myself that it was no big deal, and that even if I messed up badly people wouldn't care or remember much. I also made errors. They are to be expected, but the thing is - the audience generally wants you to succeed. I made two mistakes up there that I wish I didn't. But when you sit on stage and look out at the thousand faces, it's not really that intimidating because it's really just a lot of indistinguishable faces.

Regardless of time, wouldn't it still have oxidized (ie, turned green anyways?). Or does copper not have the same properties in the alternate universe as it has in this one? Or does New York Harbor have a completely different atmosphere there? or is the Statue of Liberty made of a different material altogether? Hmm. I'm overthinking this."

One of my very best guy friends is an ESFJ, and by that I mean he could be the poster child for the personality type. He is the friendliest, most charismatic, most gregarious, generous, loving, genuine, self-sacrificing soul I know. He will sacrifice almost anything for others, even those he does not know well, but especially for those close to him, most of all family. He has said to me many times, ""people are more important than anything else. Ever. People are always most important."" He uses this argument to rationalize staying up until 5 AM the night before exams and early classes time and time again, just to spend time talking to friends who need him. More often than not, when I see him he mentions how little sleep he got (usually 3-4 hours), and I ask him why he got so little, and the answer is always that he was spending time with friends or family. Sometimes I worry about him because he neglects his own health so often for the sake of others. I don't see how such unconditional love could be construed as negative (except perhaps for the ESFJ himself when he does things for others that drain him and his health)."

INTP,"Originally Posted by Alahric   I'm thinking about the implications of being born into a personality type, and what that means for freewill. If I'm free to do what I want, and what I want is what I prefer, and what I prefer is determined by personality type, and personality type is determined by birth. Then seeing as how I can't choose my birth, my personality type or my preference - can I choose what I want? I think the answer is obvious; yes. But if I'm prone to do something, and it makes me unhappy if I don't do it - that means what I want is basically what I prefer, I think the reason why this isn't consistent is because I can't always get what I want or at the right price or effort. But that's way too simplistic, and it doesn't take factors like beliefs or knowledge into account, and how interested or tired I am of a subject/object. Still, I think some sort of model should be applicable, but only useful if one is able to fully read people. But people are subject to change, not completely, but into better (or worse) versions of themselves. The margin of error would be too great, and people would have had to cooperate. It's ethical use is another issue, to being apple to fully predict a person - Then again I think that's what speed reading is for, but apparently I don't have the right functions (idk).    Cause and Effect... I think that given enough knowledge, one person's behaviour and reactions can be predicted. "

ENTJ,Originally Posted by Grandmaster Yoda   Do you portray yourself as a computer to fool others into thinking you are more than human?    I would find a computer lacking. To be more than human you at first have to be human. The penultimate of public perception comes to an entj when they are benevolent leaders. Personal and welcoming to each individual. If I portray anything it's that everyone is special and valuable and that I know their deepest secrets thoughts and insecurities... And I understand them.

I barely ever go out because he will question it, I barely ever work because he isn't a fan of my job, I've completely cut out my male friends because he doesn't really trust me. I'm most ashamed of this. I had told myself once I began understanding the complexities of relationships that I wouldn't be the girl to be under a mans thumb. I wouldn't beg for a man to have me.

I get myself to the point of complete exposure of my inner self only to hold back saying what I really want to say at the last minute. Instead of talking about issue A which is the real issue, I would talk about issue B and pretend to myself that I'm resolving issue A.

To dream that  you are sailing the high seas in a ship denotes that you are still  standing tall despite the emotional turmoil occurring in your life.   To dream that a ship has crashed or sunk suggests that you are feeling  emotionally out of control. You are expressing some fear or uncertainly  within your emotional state. You are afraid of losing something close to  you because of certain difficulties.   To dream that you abandon ship indicates that you need to move on and  let go.

ESFJ,"Hi Steelight! So great you're coming at it with a ""trying to understand"" mindset. I appreciate all you've said. I think in the end everything is relative and just as ESFJs may seem difficult to you (and some other types here) to communicate with, I would say the same could be said in reverse for Feelers to Thinkers. Being married to an INTP, I completely understand how these miscommunications happen but I've also seen how these can be mitigated in the future and resolved in a respectful way to each personality type. There is no one best personality type and I would venture to speculate that there is no one type that is the most difficult to talk to (objectively) if you remove your own personality bias / lens with which you see the world."

ISFP,"Confession: most my life I have cornered myself into being responsible by being completely irresponsible. I have made big choices, not thinking about the consequences and now those consequences are what I believe saved my life and drive me completely nuts on a day to day basis. :) Granted, I had life changing events at a young age that can excuse being a total wreck, but I knew better and just was so alone so going against what I knew was the ultimate way of not caring for myself as I felt no one else really did.

I'm almost too fast to forgive with friends and acquaintances, but overall I like that I am forgiving. I only am unforgiving if someone has completely crossed my value system or is openly cruel.

ISTJ,"The tea party didn't promise to cut the deficit in half and then quadruple it. The tea party didn't pass a new $1 trillion entitlement, nor did it pass an $876 billion stimulus bill which according to the CBO created about 3 million jobs at a cost of $278,000 per job (epic fail). It seems to me that the tea party House members are the only adults in the room; the only plan (that I'm aware of) to reform entitlements like Medicare has come from Paul Ryan. The only plan that would balance the budget (in just 8 years) is Congressman Connie Mack's plan. Where is the President or the Democrats' plan? They don't have a plan; they haven't passed a budget in over 2 years; the only solution they propose is to raise taxes, which wouldn't even make a dent in the $1.6 trillion budget deficit and which would very likely kill even more jobs. I don't know the MBTI make-up of Congress, but we definitely need more ISTJs and INTJs in there to do the job and make the tough decisions."

I may fb chat her asking innocently for an explanation, saying that I didn't quite understand it or something. Then she won't get defensive. I do not know why, I account it to INFJ/ISTJ conflict, but for some reason she's intimidated by me. So she may not want to BS herself in a way that I'll notice.    There's very little room for allowing communication differences to get in the way. You'll just have to be direct and up front in asking her why the bill suddenly rose. Ask whoever is also living there to get a copy of the bill. Sorry, but $30 extra with no explanation is sketchy and should have raised a red flag. I'm not ready to jump to conclusions yet, but secrecy accompanies lying. If she has a legitimate reason, she'll tell you and produce records."

I'm always surprised when I visit the local Guitar Center and see parents buying their kids expensive instruments...when they have no musical experience! Start with something reasonably priced and you can always move up if they stick with it. At the end of the school year I see lots of parents trying to sell back that instrument because their child lost interest (which happens frequently once they find out how much work and dedication it takes) Then the parents are shocked at how low the buy-back is "

ISTP,"Originally Posted by AST   Not really. While the most classic examples of technical death metal/jazz fusion did occur shortly after the inception of death metal (Atheist, Cynic, Pestilence, Death's latter output), this was separate apart from pure death metal (early Death, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, Autopsy, Deicide, etc.). Nowadays, a lot of technical death metal acts feature neo-classical or jazz influence, but it just gets drowned out in the guitar wankery. Even with the afformentioned bands, I feel like Atheist was more of a thrash/jazz fusion, Cynic was a jazz fusion band with growls and some metal riffs, and Death just had random free jazz sensibilities. Pestilence got pretty damn close to what I'm thinking with Spheres, but that was more spacy than the atmosphere I have in mind, which is more reminiscent of death/doom ala Tales from the Thousand Lakes."

I grew up with an ISFJ mother, which I would deem worse, IMO, because added to the Fe-Te dynamic, you also have the awkward Si-Se Ni-Ne dynamic. My mother probably should have been diagnosed decades ago with something. Yet, I know she loved me, and tried to do what was best for me. She did some/much things wrong, but she also did many things right. Personally, I believe I'm a more rounded person, thanks to her--her strong points, with Fe and Si strengthened my weak points. That said, I did learn some maladaptive strategies that I did not recognize for decades. HOWEVER, I would never say that I was ""unhealthy."" Personally, I think that word is used a bit much on PerC. I say that because, in the end, each of us is responsible for him or herself. We can't go through our entire lives blaming others, and especially blaming our parents for our problems. Sometimes, however, that may require doing something I did with my mother--putting significant physical distance between us. But still, I have to take responsibility for myself, and also for my marriage, and for how i rear my own children. "

I can only tell you what my ENTJ told me (& it may be different for each individual).  For him processing emotions is exhausting because he cannot always discern what I call the ""logic patterns"" of emotions (*pauses to listen to the sounds of TJ's all over the world scoffing*). To him emotions seem far too subjective, dependant on too many variables and are often too fleeting to ""waste"" the time and energy on them (unless it is absolutely essential or he knows beyond reasonable doubt that the emotion is stable).

I have been trying to enforce all these policies and, expecedtly, I have invited resistance, sometimes even from the administration I am supporting.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Unicorn Attack   Not really. I liked school because I love learning and my social skills were always decent. At work, I wouldn't say it was an issue necessarily, but one of my first full-time jobs after college rubbed me the wrong way. The majority of the work was seasonal, so the busy time of year lasted a few months and then it was completely dead. I hated the dead months. My mind was too active and I became really irritable. If I hadn't moved on to another job I probably would have created problems because I was so unhappy.    "
ISFJ,"P.S. She has a kitty and loves to cuddle it... and whenever we see each other, she just wants to cuddle. I think she may like cuddling more than sex"
ISTP,"I fainted a couple of times and had a fever. I remember, between the second and third faint thinking, man I wish I had this on video, this is ridiculous.    :O You're fainting? Gosh, that's awful. Glad I missed out on that. You have people checking on you regularly?"
ISTJ,"@hello317 , I sense you're frustrated with and/or hating on zeth.  What's the dealio?    Probably because I'm proof to her that ISTJs can be self-flatterers! Shatters her idealistic and romantic image of the goody-goody two-shoes, boy scout ISTJ."

ISTJ,"Well, probably because drills are circular in shape.  I've never seen a square, triangle, or non-circular shaped drill...and I imagine such a drill would be difficult to engineer.  In short, because it's easier to make circles than other shapes."
ISTJ,Sitting in the library all alone and sipping an expresso. Kind of disappointed that my research this weekend didn't turn over as much as I'd hoped. I'm going to have to spend extra hours at Starbucks over a cup of tea organizing my notes and thoughts on the research so I can present something to the boss come Monday morning. Wednesday morning is when our response to the other side's pleadings are due. I haven't figured out whether there WILL be a D-Day in which the allied forces (my firm) will get a shot at storming the beaches of Normandy. The enemies (opposing side) surely won't give us an easy shot.    What kind of tea do you drink at Sbux?
ENTJ,"Definitively walking away from things is hard for me (and many ENFPs) because I/we see the potential in everything.

INFJ,"Me, I'm the logic & reason... the knight of the realm, if you will, that protects that which lies within.  And I did a poor job.  I didn't stop the fair maiden at the gate.

And then she cut him with a big knife... and he withdrew, hurt, and started putting up walls... but he, being him... and being trusting & hopeful... he let her back in.  He kept his guard up, he let go much slower... but he let her back in, again.  And he had started to believe.  Fully believe... the 15 yr plan... all of it.  He thought things were going well.  He was happy.  He was wrong.  "
ESTJ,Originally Posted by Neon Rain   Are ESTJs uncomfortable with being open and honest in a relationship? would they rather leave their significant other in the dark and let them figure everything out?

ESFP,"Originally Posted by air.ee.yell   While in a relationship do you ever happen to seek ""thrills"" but don't actually cheat? I met an ESFP once who seemed fun and flirty but then a week of flirting back and forth, he told me he had a girlfriend. But then he told me he still wanted to be friends. I'm wondering if this is something that ESFPs somehow think this is okay. Well, actually, I just want to hear other ESFP's thoughts on the situation.    It depends on how serious the relationship is. If the relationship is not that serious then there's a lot of ""accidental"" flirty behavior that comes out. "
ENFJ,"WTF?    That's actually cute.  You should set some limits to what gets to you and what shouldn't.

ISTJ,"So the crazy housemate I had last year had this crazy ""eco-friendly"" idea of disconnecting the pipes. It allows the water to flow in buckets which we pour into the toilet and use it to flush. I won't really go into how unhealthy it is to flush the toilet that way (bouncing water) but she ruined the pipes on the left side along with the area underneath the sink. The landlord was pissed when we brought the sink to his attention today, fortunately not at us. He's stopping the returned deposit he sent her and sending someone over her to fix it. He said stuff like ""she's caused me enough trouble already"" and ""she's never stepping into this house again."" He also said that that was dangerous as it could have let in sewer gases, which are deadly. "

ENTP,"The reason I take issue with sophistry is because, like Mr. Turnbull, the overwhelming majority of people who run the world, are sophists. Socrates and Plato certainly didn't think the Sophists were wise but, rather, cunning and disreputable, willing to use their intelligence to present specious arguments to bamboozle and persuade the ignorant. The Sophists of ancient Greece were itinerant teachers cum lawyers, selling their services to the highest bidder. They would defend any position if the money was right. So, clearly, exactly like modern lawyers/bankers/politicians, they had no regard for the truth at all. The idea that America should have a Supreme Court composed of lawyers is surely one of the sickest jokes in history. No sane person would trust a lawyer with a bottle of water, never mind a Constitution."

ISFJ,"I think in general ISFJ's are just more sensitive than ISTJ's, both about themselves and when it comes to other people.  I use my mom as an example (she's an ISTJ).  My mom is an extremely caring person, she works very hard, she puts other people before herself, etc.  But I think she almost seems to do all of that out of a sense of duty.  It's almost like she does it because she believes it's right.  It seems she can do it on auto-pilot."

ESTP,It's worse for me. They say ESFPs and INTJs are meant to be together.
ESFJ,"@Ashes4719 , dealing with arguments as an ESFJ married to an INTP is tricky sometimes. Fortunately, we've been married for 10+ years now so it's gotten easier. He tries to split hairs on wordings of things and used to in the past try to make everything sound like it had to be totally logical (like emotions weren't valid arguments, etc). Little things I just let go and for big things, we found it's usually best for him to take some introverted alone time and cool down (even though I as an extrovert want to talk about it immediately... but that usually ends up badly so we've found over the years to just let the introvert go get some space for awhile then come back and talk). Once we reconvene to talk more calmly, there are times in the past when I just back peddle and think in my head this isn't worth it and let's just get along again and move forward. Now I've gotten better at actually talking through things and not back peddling just to avoid conflict. He's gotten better at validating my feelings and realizing there's a ""feeler logic"" that may not always stack up with concrete facts etc. Without that realization, it was hard at the way beginning of our relationship because I felt really misunderstood and he in return felt very frustrated by not understanding what was happening logically plus getting flooded by confusing emotions (mine and his)."

My stepdad was an ESTJ and had a very ""my-way-or-the-highway"" approach to everything. Even when I would explain a more efficient alternative. I remember being a kid arguing with him for hours about things like why I should be allowed to sleep with my door closed, or why 10:30 was a more appropriate bedtime. Though, with age I have come to understand them, and my stepdad and I get along MUCH better now that I am a grown man. One of my closest friends for years is an ESTJ and while I do see him as somewhat of a conformist, he's a good guy at heart(same with my stepdad). Though, the ones I know do seem completely not open to the idea of interacting with people that they have heard are ""weird"". They also seem to be completely devoid of any imagination."

ENTP,"No. My desire to watch people squirm seems unending. At least until I get bored. I even call what I do torture therapy which is primarily helping others overcome embarrassment or fear by making sure they are so exposed to whatever they are irrational bothered by and survive it no longer holds any power over them. But the truth be told rule one of Torture therapy is that is is first for the therapist's amusement. And truth be told (again) we ENTPs know how to help by just giving someone a re-frame but that's just not as much fun. For example once (when I was much younger) I was at a restaurant with friends and one of them was afraid of being the center of attention so I got everyone there to remain silent until she spoke. She was quite frightened, so it took a little while before she finally said something just to get everyone else to start participating and conversing again. I'm not sure if it helped her in the long run but it was certainly fun and amusing to me. Which of course is the point of tortured therapy to amuse the therapist. If I was nice I could've just pulled her aside, and explained that her fear of being the center of attention was probably Due to a misunderstanding of how much other people consider others. The problem is they really don't so there's no reason to be afraid of being the center of attention because no one's paying attention anyway and even if they did who cares their opinion doesn't matter. And in a group of friends everyone is generous and compassionate so there's no reason to worry about what anyone else thinks. But that would've been so much less fun to tell her that it actually have her experience what she feared the most which is what comes off as being mean."

ENFP,"Overall I prefer T's as opposed to F's, though the two F's I mentioned, are my absolute closest friends of all of them. T's I enjoy to speak with on a regular basis, it's intellectually stimulating, turns me on, and I'm able to have a deep conversation, something I greatly enjoy. Though with my two best friends, the ENFJ, and ISFJ, well I've known them a long time, they know I just don't tolerate drama, although being an F, and so we don't have it. I've never had problems with either of them. Minor episodes where one of us was going through a rough time and sought consolation, but that's not drama to me, drama is starting shit up for no reason. Sometimes it's necessary to bring an issue up, but if it's just bitching, I don't put up with it, and my friends know it. So generally, T's are good to ground me and have that sophisticated and stimulating conversation I crave rather often, and F's are fantastic to just let loose and let the glittery Llamacorn inside prance around. (llamacorn is a crossbreed between a unicorn and llama, doubt you'd know it. *equips oversized glasses*) But yeah, so I like em all. I'm a lover though."

I'm not like my best friend who is probably ESTP where working out and getting ripped is something he loves but working out to stay healthy ( as you say) and stay in decent shape offers a bit of self discipline that I would normally lack.    I'm a really amazing cook.  I don't load up on too many heavy things. I try to get my green smoothie in once a day and I seem to love Kale chips.  But I'm not worried if I don't eat healthy as long as I have at least 4 cups of dark leafy greens a day, it's a health thing.  I never stress over the calories."

ESFP,"Originally Posted by sonnetfirelight   Ty. You are very helpful. He said it like it was the past. Heh. And I have no idea what cool and awesome are supposed to mean. They are so vague I can't wrap my brain around them, but no guy has really been able to describe how they felt about me clearly (not ESFPs or ENFPs). Heh. I don't think he'd ever ask for space directly, but passive aggressively perhaps? I just don't want to annoy him.  Hmm. Well, I tend to over-react perhaps with the enneagram 4, but 2 of my exes have used foul language at me when they were angry. Perhaps I have nothing to worry about, but he is somewhat like the 2 others. Just seemingly sweeter and rambles more. Heh. I just don't know if I actually mean much or anything to him, and if I don't, then I don't want to entertain it. I also want to make sure it's not just sexually, and I don't know what all to do about that. He brings out a great side in me and in himself. He's so relaxed and funny. I don't know how to cut things off if I feel they need to be, and I have no idea how to ask politely w/o offending him if he's seeing me because he's bored. He gets somewhat easily offended and I don't want to attack his character. I've been guilty of/done the same.    Sounds like an ESFP to me.  Don't feel pressured to do anything you don't want to do or are not ready for.  Be very honest and direct as that's how ESFP's are and they appreciate that trait in others.  You might have to be the voice of reason in this relationship.  Since ESFP's live in the moment it's very easy for them to just go with their passion without giving much thought to any future contingencies."

After I asked her I walked up stairs and she stormed out of the house and clearly slammed the door. I'm so sick of this passive crap. This is the third time I've gotten a note from one of them. The second time, I requested that they talk to me in person instead. I try really hard to be a good roommate and respect their wishes, which I will continue to do. It just feels useless at this point.    Thats about the rudest thing ever if you ask me. With some people you cant make amends with. You just have to ditch them, or they ditch you. If theres been problems with the person for while."
ISTJ,"Well, more detail. She's repeatedly avoided talking to me on and off. Those first two times I mentioned here on PerC were just the first few times when I started noticing that trend. Yes, I do take part of the blame off her for the fact that we hang out with different friends. But it's a bit unsettling knowing she was approaching me all the time without a hint of an interest in just being friends! Also, a friend of mine who heard my story tells me there's a good possibility Jane just knows how to act nice and polite for the sake of manners and keeping up that friendly yet unthreatening image. I hate jumping to conclusions, but something in the back of my mind thinks some of that goody goody image might be kinda fake if she's been using it on and off to try to get me to notice her, and not to befriend me!"
ISFP,"I work with an ISFP and at some point i had the impression that he liked me because he kept making small gestures like compliments, small gifts and he touched me about every time he passed by my desk. Honestly he was really nice to me and he also told me that he is being nice to me (he wanted me to confirn that).Then i realized that he compliments just about everyone and is touchy in general. But the thing is he says these things half-jokingly, e.g. that he likes me, that we should do something together, that he'd send me a love letter  or he makes refrences to ""our"" future kids.  He says it in a serious way and a second later he laughs and says just kidding. Then after a few seconds he says ""or not"". Or he jokes about me by assuming i love him. Like when i talk about places for MY honeymoon, he'd say ""don't i get a say in that?"""

While you're asleep, your consciousness -- which is the only think that links your mind (whatever it may be) to the world around you -- is turned off and instead flooded with random data that usually has just a little to do with the world around you. You can't consciously perform the action of falling asleep, you can only do it ""accidentally"" if your body chooses to do so for you. You can't even necessarily wake yourself up unless your body decided to do so for you, usually because of some sort of physical input to your body."

But with my maths teacher especially, you just knew what he said was true, because he oozed of math. He understood it on the most fundamental level.    Yeah, and I've found that at higher levels, it's pretty easy to distinguish lecturers/teachers who expect you to 'just know' something as opposed to those who show you how to get there and where it all came from.

ENFP,"I had the deepest and most chaotic romance with an ENFP. I kind of want to try for an XNFP again... but... we sucked at conflict. I guess I'm hoping to hear its possible/happens but expecting a big fat ""no!"".    I'm in a relationship with an INFP right now. We've had to deal with a couple conflicts, but surprisingly few. I would say the more conflict ridden area of our lives is our relationship with ourselves and our goals. It's important to have a partner who will sit and listen and reassure without getting too annoyed by a gloomy disposition. I think we've both done our share of this for each other so it works out pretty well and feels balanced. "

ISTP,"Last year, I was involved in two ugly break-ups. One made my life at work so hellish that I quit, and the other put me out $2000. I paid for this man's rent, living expenses, and Christmas presents for 7 kids when he couldn't afford it and when I couldn't afford my own rent, he took a shit all over me for daring to ask if he'd pay me anything back after receiving his income tax return. My most recent ex lived with me for 7 months, only paying rent once, and refused to move out when I told him the relationship was over. I slept on the floor for a week because I couldn't stand to share the bed. He kept trying to touch me. I was afraid to leave the house, I was afraid to shower, for fear he would retaliate in some way. And, of course, there was my ex-husband who abused, blackmailed, and stalked me for years before our divorce was final."

You ignore said advise and then give him exactly what I told you that he wanted from you, therefore perpetuating the problem.

I'm also not sure why anyone would want to talk to me, to be honest (I'm such a bundle of insecurities sigh)."
ISFP,"I'm curious about how you understood Ni when you were learning about cog functions? Just wondering because I thought it might help confused people trying to type themselves. For example, I think I have tert Si and it took me a long time of periodic reading to really get Ni in general (I wondered if it was maybe my tertiary function instead).

ENTJ,"Would you prefer to stay in a room for a week with nothing but your laptop, an internet connection and all the basic necessities?    I can stay alone for long periods of time and have, due to the geographic nature of where I live (got snowed in for 16 days last winter down my long gravel lane).  I just turned it into an adventure and kept myself occupied by hiking around the springs (I find it fascinating that the water flows from a hole in the ground despite air temps), throwing snowballs at my German Shepherd, and walking up the lane daily to assess what the odds were that I could get out (on top of my online classes, of course).  I did get someone in a 4WD to pick me up at the barn once and restocked, ate dinner out and got my people fix.  When I've been bogged in study and home-based work in past summers, I've stayed alone at home for up to a week, again using the outdoors, side projects, and my pool for recharges until I had time to get out.  Makes me antsy, but I can and have done it."

I still feel like that (hard to stop totally thinking like that, no matter how much you try and break the habit), but the feeling has lessened. I mean, I can't expose myself anymore than that, can I?"
ISTJ,"I did a trial of eharmony, but there were no mbti questions. There were questions where the answer would narrow down type, though. One seemed to be trying to ask if I was a thinker or feeler."

They did some really mean things to me where most people won't be able to forgive but overtime, I started feeling guilty for no longer communicating with them. The others that I slowly stopped talking to, I did it because I felt they did not want me in their lives anymore. I would notice that conversations start becoming shorter and they stop contacting me as much as they used to. To make things easier for them, I just slowly stop initiating contact. Those are the ones that hurt the most.     See this is why I like ISFJs. Though, sometimes you can be infuriatingly selfless. Convincing you to do something for yourself every once in a while is quite difficult."
ESTJ,Is this thing related to mbti types or is it just an older brother thing? Because my friend's older brothers are totally cool giving advices to my friend on approaching guys.

ENTJ,"One thing that I have also noticed was that you post in this subforum A LOT. You seem to be in constant rapid-fire mode and tend to clutter the threads here. So not only you are not being selective about what you post, but you clutter multiple threads here. Outside of annoying ENTJs, you're also making it difficult for other people to ask questions and talk about things because their posts can get lost among your many, many posts. "

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ferroequinologist   Most Ne types that are really and obviously Ne types show up quick--at least to me. Ne is like an explosion of words, jumping from topic to topic in what could be called a random order, but there is either a common thread to it all, or a series of connections, regardless of how loose. Se is more searching around in circles for the same thing (possibly the weaker Ni). With this combo, and Se in the fore, one tends to repeat in different ways, seeking for an apt expression to say the same thing, only better. It's like it's prodding and prodding, ever poking inward, and more precisely over time. I think that Ni, when it's stronger is more prone to just say it aptly the first time around, and to repeat more for effect. "

INTP,"I want to make propaganda posters. They're stupid, but also interesting."
ESFP,"Also this is not the first time he ignored me for days when I've asked an important relationship question, so I'm angry that he hurts me despite knowing I get upset each time he ignores me. I've told him that it hurts when he disappears but he doesn't seem to learn from it."
ESTJ,"That can be read two ways in fact. It depends on the tone of the person too and its why online words do not translate well in terms to others. Im asking with sincere aspect of understanding because i see all this stuff about ESTJs and it contradicts and it feels wrong too. I want the truth and closure so I am asking from the source. I can understand if you feel protective of them but I do mean no harm. You shouldnt be so judgmental of people like that. Its not understanding English because again you assume I know what you mean and what you are talking about.  What does it mean to be good at English in your eyes? Because people have different takes on it. Like I do not even know what ESL means. As an INFP, i think I would not question what I believe in correct? I believe in children and consistency, especially with honor and words. I do not feel a need to question this. Yet here I am questioning these stereotypes that pop in my mind when I hear ESTJ and when I read people's words and on google. Its annoying. SO, I am asking for answers. I can understand how that sentence can mean ""Well i think it is so you should prove to me how it is not."" But I did not mean it that way to which I apologize. If you do not believe me or want to say I am this and that so be it. But I know what I am asking and I really should not have to explain that except to an ESTJ (since the question is directed at them)."

ESTP,(Is that a crazy attempt at a silly joke?)    No. I genuinely wish I knew a prostitute or two.

Maybe i'm a little bit more volatile then, I'm liable to get pissed off easy I suppose, but actually get *angry* is another thing altogether.

ESTP,"I think I could possibly be better at trying to adapt to her style and explain things to her so she gets it (rather then just snap at her with no explanation). So even the butter story you talked about my thoughts were his home his wallet he does not owe you a fucking explanation about the butter (even if he is being a hypocrite and does not provide open dialogue and a voice later for bigger concerns). The point is he is entitled to say he does not like one thing and maybe he is in denial (could be which does suck for you to communicate with). He still even if wrong does not owe you an explanation. It may very well be a double standard which he does not account for, he buys the fucken butter right so if he asks you to put the fucken butter away shooting back ""but you dont"" probably is not, well productive. Even if a double standard.  As I was trying to get to. I personally do want my kids to have a voice and so I highly highly define the lines, by all means come to me with a concern on your own, not in a moment of being called out.

ESTP,PM and let me know if you're interested :) We have yet to have an ESTP on there (from all the vids I've seen so far).
INTP,Random mean and witty thought from the depths of my brain... Why should I go to their funeral if they're never going to come to mine? Hehe... my brain... :P
ENTJ,"p.s. i'm pretty misanthropic. in addition to not caring what people think of me, i distrust people indiscriminately. in order to get my needs met i know i need to be able to trust some people, or some people in some contexts, to be smarter about it. i know what i really distrust is my own capacity for extroverted thinking, my own insight, and my own ability to recognize attempts at manipulation and be better at it than the person who is trying to manipulate me."
ISTP,"Whatevs. I've listened to and played a lot of death metal and jazz too, I get the appeal."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Camus   Are you stalkers if you care someone or something?    No. But i get stalked a lot. Lol. Personally, when i want to know one or two things from anyone i'll just ask him/her directly about. To me, stalking is less effective, inefficient and a waste of time as no matter how much information i can get from it would still requires a lot of guessing, speculating, wondering without any real basic clue and the result is most likely just an innaccurate conclusion. Hell, my direct presence and act over someone is already the way of me to show my interest over him/her."
ESTP,"Sorry, I realize this is probably TMI for an ESTP thread but I just had to get it out, so thanks for asking. I am open to any feedback!"
INTP,"Originally Posted by Fienigma   You know, that's like your opinion, man.

INFJ,I just realised that video clip was accompanied with a request for more dogs in our library.
ENFJ,You're reserved? Is that what it is? After like fucking weeks of this shit? Still so fucking reserved? FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
INTP,Anyway. Hmmm. I NEED TO GO INSANE... SO I CAN LIVE IN PEACE! What an amazing realisation!    I would have no problem with this either provided the floor was padded as well.
ESTP,Originally Posted by itsme45   Just to be sure of no misunderstanding: by crazy attempt at silly joke I meant my own line.
INFP,he was the ONLY person that really knew me and got me.
ENFJ,Would I complete myself without the things I like around?
ISTJ,Flushing with your foot is an acquired talent but it can be done.
ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Cal   If a person does not want to read things that they do not agree with, then they would not be on the internet in the first place. Don't like what I said? Did it offend you? then just ignore my post."
ISTJ,"@zeth006 : Your friend's logic does sound a bit off - so people in the 'lower economic strata' have the right to change the whole world, yet are not entitled to receive  education??"
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Scarlet.Black   Made of flannel? I am afraid that they don't sell those in Finland...:D  I have a big collection of different kind of underwears, garters, high heels etc... I think that many INFJs like those things.    Yea, those are great too. I'm not saying only onesie's are hot. I like 'emo all dolled and sexed up sometimes, let her, garters, little whip, but other times simple can be surprisingly sexy. Pics are worth many words so something like this..."
ISFJ,"I definitely know NTJs can be very caring people, and I'm not saying they can't be.  But speaking generally, I don't think that SFJs and NTJs feel caring in the same sort of way, and they don't express it in the same sort of way.  That's just a general statement, it's not true across the board."
ENTJ,So if I know someone that's bisexual in the sense that they get it on when they feel a proper urge then cool that's awesome to be in tune with instincts.
ISFJ,"- please don't act like your opinion is the only right one! It is maybe for you, but not for everyone :P"
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Fear Itself   I feel like I'm pretty good at reading certain aspects of people, but when it comes to reading social cues... what?    Hahahaha! Relate to this so much. "
ENFP,@NIHM  be ok with you sharing your..hehemmm..Twinkie ...with another lady?    It was her idea! She thought it was messed up that I ate 
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Lblanc   All the descriptions of ENFJs that I've read say that we turn to dark  thoughts when we're alone. I'm completely in that dark, lonely place  right now and I have no idea why. I just feel so sad, and none of the  people in my close circle of friends are here to talk to. I'm having a  rough time keeping my realist mentality. I feel so negative just from a  few days off and some extra alone time. I feel completely pathetic that  my happiness is so reliant on others.. "
ISTP,"Damn I loath banner ads, pop-ups and 'tageted marketing'. I remember the 'old days' when....."
ENTP,Originally Posted by MisterDantes   I like sarcasm. I'll post a question of my own:

I'm one of those crazy Christians who doesn't believe in revenge and thinks everyone should be loved unconditionally :D So far this has worked out pretty well for me, so I'm sticking to it. I've never been in your situation, so I can't really say what I'd do, or how I'd feel, but I'd hope to stick to the values I have. I don't generally like making decisions based on feelings, they're superfluous and can lead me astray. I don't want to impose my values on anyone else, but I have to say I agree with you Hobbes.    Doesn't mean I'll be doing his taxes."
ESFJ,"On the off chance, I might criticize my every move when I am thinking about another person."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Julia Bell   I'm thinking of my feelings of now. And the funny thing is. Do I stop and question whether those feelings are ""appropriate"" or valid? No. I just feel them. They're there. And I feel them deeply... I wonder if that's a kind of Fi-thing?    Yes, it is a Fi thing."
ENTJ,"2. If you were planning on emigrating, where would you go and why?"
INTJ,Objective truth exists. To argue otherwise is illogical.
ENTP,Originally Posted by Ronney   How do you know i didn't here someone else say it or even someone on TV. Unless you spying on me ?    *Ni triggered* 
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Queen Riley   Do you consider yourself a good liar? If so, why?    Don't agree with lying, but I can be very good at bluffing in games/ for fun/ etc."
ENFP,"Yoga, exercise, journaling, long walks, nature, quiet time, prayer- (and meds unfortunately) worked for me."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by kittychris07   The one problem I could foresee is the fact that I have Internet Explorer.  I don't want to delete it, though maybe I will if there is not an adequate program to manage my time using it.  But of course, I could just get on IE to view this website if I don't have a good enough program.  "
ENTP,"Originally Posted by apa   We eat brains for breakfast, that explains why I always starve so much when I am in your presence.    /sarcasm off."
ISTJ,"Boredom, or seeking to feel relaxed. Yeah, there's not a whole lot for me to do here otherwise. "
INFJ,I'm gonna ride it with a helmet on so no one will know it is me. 
ESFJ,but now that he has his job/woman/kid(s) ? That is shrinking out.
INFJ,Taking mom out for Red Lobster tonight... cuz I feel like gorging on seafood.      My post is that this one makes me happy.
INFP,"Jesus fuck.    Yeah, I got in trouble for responding to their posts with a picture of the album cover of Atom & His Package's Attention! Blah Blah Blah. I thought it was funny. I guess the mods did not agree. Oh well. It's their forum, they can do what they want with it. Lalala."
ENFP,"Wheni say meaning that the other is the special one in my heart,  I do all uptighty and awkward, almost shaken, looking deep in the eyes, my voice is different. .."
INTJ,"Originally Posted by antiant   No, they are not me at least in the physical sense, but they are very much 'me' in the way they are portrayed/chosen, if that makes sense. I'm not the type to post pictures of myself on a public forum.    That's probably it. I thought they reminded me of you, yet I wasn't sure they all looked like the same person..."
ISTP,TENSIONS ARE BOILING AND I THINK SOMEONE IS GOING TO PUNCH HER OUT.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by ThirdArcade   I cannot understand why you guys don't initiate. By asking me to hanging out directly, it helps me to understand that he not just exchanging pleasantries with me & that he just actually wants to hang out. I would feel so awkward if he said 'no' - in that way I feel like I misinterpreted the entire situation. I'd be really embarrassed. Maybe I should remove the 'feeling' aspect of this situation?    In addition to what's been said already, as introverts, being alone is our default mode. We can stay in it for a very long time without batting an eye. Even if there's someone we like being with, we have to get over the hump between default mode and the special case of getting out."
ESTP,being literal (before one actively searches for other meaning)
ISTP,"She was like ""I was drinking a lot of redbull at the time"" and I'm like ""which is disgusting"" and I saw this micro-expression... her lips actually twisted or something, I said ""you don't agree huh? I saw what you did there, with your lips."" And I can always tell where she is energetically, even when our other friends seem oblivious. I am not conscious of what I'm doing, I just read all of the energy, expression, I can SEE it, it is transparent to me."
ENFJ,"Don't be afraid to hop out of the train you are currently in, even if it hurts, or you might very well lose the train you were actually looking for."
INFJ,"Originally Posted by Aubbs   So you have to babysit delinquents. Sounds fun! I would cause mayhem by making a mass army of delinquents... why not :D    Essentially, yes.  That's actually not a bad idea.  I don't mind the kids... but the people I work with (and more specifically, for) are a bunch of damned morons.  Maybe that's what I should do... raise an army of minor minions!  Plot grand conspiracies to take over the facility... one unit at a time.  Bwahahahahaaaa..."
ISFJ,Here is a completely new topic. I like an ISFJ and we've been getting to know each other for going on three months now. For you guys what would be your average wait time to decide you want to be in a relationship with someone. Also it's long distance and we have yet to meet in person.
INTP,"ugh, why is this guy from my past texting me with pointless small talk, like asking me if I have a job... I don't understand this.."
INTP,"I feel like my ideal vision of beauty was highly influenced by the media.    I don't think the media has influenced me directly, possibly indirectly through others. I meant conditioning by being around someone repeatedly. Have you ever had someone grow on you? Like when you first meet them you think they're alright, but as you see them more and more they become attractive."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by _haphazard   Are you guys having a hard time convincing your friends to watch a particular TV series (like you have to search the Internet to get the big picture because all that's in your head are too concrete/specific why you liked it)?    lol no. i just tell them to watch it. and perhaps tell them the parts of the show that I love, or I know they will love too. I ll remind them one more time. after that, i dont really care anymore. lol."
ENFJ,"*hugglez* :3    Thanks, KC Tan, oh, I miss you guys. :) "
ESTP,When it comes to Women I snap when competition is  around.

INTP,Is it just me or has the posting reduced? Have INTPs suddenly gotten social lives now?
ENTJ,"***You're my gleefully racist neighbor who over the years has alienated virtually everyone in the neighborhood with your bullshit, went full-blown Trump and now you are being either completely shunned/shamed by some, or taunted by others because of your behavior. (The neighbors are going full-blown Fe on you.) You brought this on yourself.  Your actions have consequences.  I'm not interested in your problem. I'm completely ignoring you.  Not only do I not feel sympathy for you, what I feel borders on Schadenfreude because who I feel sympathy for are the people you've hurt.    Whoah, talk about having identical reactions to these situations!!"
ENFJ,I'm scared for my Sound Design grade. I might actually fail.
INFJ,"Originally Posted by HollyGolightly   I hate the fact I act properly all the time.

So I act really calm and gracious instead, then I go home and clean because that's how I relieve stress. I'm a really exciting person, try to keep up with me if you can :p    Wish i could thank that many times over."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by devoid   How could I grab your attention after we've previously talked a few times before without seeming odd?    Be odd, but intriguingly/charmingly so. Be yourself, most of all. With your inner variety, that should do it - for a worthy man."
ESFJ,"It's weird. As an INTP, these all seem like the things right at the back of my mind. Yes, I'm invading your forums"
ISFP,"In any case, to summarize, I wouldn't necessarily blame the ISFPs for being unhealthy. It's just that being ourselves can lead others to misreading and acting wrongly accordingly. But the bad times come when they cross the boundaries. Once those are crossed, and the bad times come, anything goes."
ISFJ,"The only pitfalls for the ISFJ come in the form of being overly driven by morality, or putting too much stock into authority (for instance, during Hitler's reign, Nazi ISFJs would have been amongst the first to shovel people into ovens, not out of hatred or cruelty, but rather out of deep respect for authority and an extremely strong yearning to belong), but that's about the worst thing you can say about an ISFJ."
ENFJ,"What the hell does everyone want from me? A big part of me is just like ""LEAVE ME ALONE"". Another big part of me is like ""WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE? NOTHING!"""
INFJ,"I've had lots of close friends, and my best friend and I have known each other for about 15 years."
ENTJ,"I think it depends on how it's used. If it's in your arsonal because you lack the ability or intellect to come up with anything better and you just whip it out to try to take down the other person by being insulting ( see: the comments section on any random internet chat) then yes, it's a defense mechanism.

ISFJ,"I'm not even that angry or disappointed anymore. But once you've told me you didn't want me around, I won't be, I can't be until you at the very least tell me you didn't mean it."
ESFP,"Well, since I want to do things with him, maybe I now may be doing too much of the chasing? I am shy at first, but when I get used of the person, I take initiatives (But it may be too much)."
ENFJ,Originally Posted by Jawz   Whatever gave you the idea that that isn't what I want ;) 
ISFJ,"You know you're a ISFJ if you have a box of memories with every hand written letter you've ever gotten from High School years ago, and you can still remember the day you got it, and what the letter will say before finishing the first sentence. You will also remember how it made you feel the first time you read it."
ESFJ,"You seem quite reasonable which I appreciate. This is probably because of your understanding and experience with INTP's due to much exposure (We're very complex creatures, but with simple needs). I've never encountered an INFJ girl though which is new.    1) Yeah INTPs and INTJs, and correct me if I'm wrong, are usually associated with the extreme ends of the intellectual spectrum. :)"
ISFJ,"Not sure if this is all ISFJs, but whenever I'm in my room and I see a fly or some other bug, I start talking to it without thinking. Something like ""Hello, Mr Buggybug! Are you alive? *poke poke* You are! Excellent."" I talk to everything, really. And I know they won't talk back, I just feel like someone should give them some love. I talk to other people in their cars, as well, whenever I drive. Not just rude things, either. Just small talk. I compliment their bumper stickers, ask them if they're having a bad day causing them to drive like an ass."
ISFJ,"You know you are an ISFJ when you feel guilty for feeling valid negative emotions, that do need to be communicated.     xD. It really depends on who the person is. also does it happen a lot? do they have a geniune reason each time, and does their reasons seem reasonable each time? but yes, sooner or later I will be the same way xD"
INFJ,It's clean enough anyhow.  Whoever buys it will buy it for the land or business stuff.  The house is basic.
INFJ,"Me:  Not going to work, I haven't signed in years & I've forgotten most of what I knew."
INFP,"People wait for things to change. When in reality, everything is always changing. Everything is fragile. If you notice the subtleties of everything- from relationships to individual people; that's where all the magic lies. "

ISTP,"Goddamn it, stop being cute and adorable, or I will have to steal you."
ENFJ,I'm very worried about my brother. He was in a really bad truck accident and they took an hour to cut him out of the truck. Now they are doing surgery on his knees and legs which were pretty much crushed. 
ISFJ,"1) When you know (can sense that) someone's upset, and they don't tell you anything, you spend the entire time they are with you trying to think of something to say to make them feel better, but you don't know what's wrong exactly, so you spend the entire time you are with them not saying anything but worrying all the while. Then you just give them a hug and spend a long time after feeling guilty you couldn't do anything."
ESFJ,2. You often feel misunderstood and are compelled to explain how you feel about it.

ENFJ,"Dad told me to reject the application politely, stating that I have been scouted by others instead. Aside from that, he also told me to actually do their writing test and send them whatever review they told me to write. It was sorta ""my way"" of contributing back somehow.

The past two years I largely conquered and broke it, locked it up where it can't readily hurt me, made defenses against its destructiveness in terms of personal boundaries that now chain it. Now I see its purpose, its value as my extraverted judging function, the key to being ever more confident, reliable, committed, and satisfied with life and positively connected to other human beings in a fulfilling and productive way. The beast has been broken and locked up, but now it is time to domesticate it. Slowly but surely I can train it in the ways of the world that can benefit me and others. I'll be working on taking it out for more walks in controlled environments. "

Intense dialogue, meaningful, rich characters and scenes. Plunged right into some good stuff. As it went on, I didn't really understand what was happening. Hmm, this isn't making sense. Who's that? Why are we here now? Why's he want to kill him? *shrug* Maybe it's one of those shows that starts off in the middle of a plot line? I have to fill in the blanks, that's it. I like that, it makes me more creative. Thoughtful writers, they are. Hmph, well I can do that. La de da...I finished the episode. I decided to Google it to rehash and make more sense of what happened. Come to find...the first episode description is not at all what I watched. I accidentally watched episode nine instead. Drat, so not only do I know what happens nine episodes into the season, and have a pretty good idea of what happens in between, I read the description of episode one. It's funny, but it bothers me I didn't even notice. I want to give the show a legitimate chance because I like having imaginary relationships with characters. So...I'll watch episode one later tonight...eyerolls at self."

INTP,"Did I chose too? Some may say I did. Some may think, I, nor everyone else, don't chose to do anything.

If this is the case, the universe already knew I was going to type this out, word for word, error corrected for error correction. The universe knew I was going to write this, at this particular time, in this particular place. Is this why the events listed above happened? So I can write this out now? If so, then what is the purpose of this text? To get others to think of free will?"

But some ESTJs can be very quite and not social, simply because they aren't interested in what the group is talking about, but once you talk to them about themselves or something they know, you can tell this person could have a conversation with a wall, meaning that once they get started they do not require you to speak anymore lol,<< Extrovert.

He opened himself up to me so willingly...but in the end, I ended up rejecting him and he was shattered. I fear he has this image of me as some sort of heartbreaker...I'm not.

ISFP,"I've never been what I would call a religious person, but I've always believed in God. I was baptized Catholic and received First Communion. I connected with the Church when I was really young, but my parents would never take me to church even though I asked for them to. I think they had bad experiences when they were kids, plus they were part of that generation that started cutting ties with religion. Anyways, lack of church and love of science pushed me into a certain direction and my love of learning about he world through science mostly replaced my spiritual needs. In college I became agnostic, but a new age friends taught me a few things about spirituality, and that renewed my desire for the divine, if only temporarily. After college I dabbled in Native American spirituality and other earth spiritualities. Then after reading Tolkien I found out he was a devout Catholic. That got me reinterested in exploring my Catholic roots. I found beauty in the church, the rituals, the music. I had my first daughter baptized in the Church. I felt like I was making some head way in my life until a coworker made me feel like such an idiot for believing in anything because she was a militant atheist(her words, not mine). It crushed me. Since my faith wasn't that strong yet I eventually let it go. Then I became an atheist. I read some Dawkins, Hitchens, and a few others. I felt that was the lowest I have ever felt and the opposite of kind of person I was up to that point in life. After that I moved away from atheism and moved into spirituality again, checking out zen, taoism, hinduism. I went to a zen sangha. I checked out unitarian universalism. But what I felt I really needed was a church, the community, the beauty. I don't care much for theology or doing things according to some doctrine, but I have a strong need to belong, to love others, and be loved, to do good in the world. I don't feel I can belong to the Catholic Church because of the priest scandals, the politics mixing with religion, the divisiveness. Plus because I don't care much for absolute truth and doctrine, and I don't see anything wrong with people being gay, lesbian, or with priests being married, or with women clergy. I don't see the big deal. Each person is unique, that is the way we born. We should honor that as long as no one is harming anyone else. So I checked out an episcopal church, not because of some ideology but because they don't make such a fuss over silly things like birth control and sexual preference. That way I can focus on community, family, and the beauty of world, the beauty of the services, while nurturing my spirituality and making a difference in the world. That has always been a hard thing to balance, my need for spiritually with my distrust of organized religion, sometimes the structure of it is just suffocating, but I'm getting to that point in my life where I have to nurture my soul. Okay, I'm done rambling now. I just needed to get all that all out! Thanks for listening :)"

I decided I'm going to get him Republic, by Plato. He loves it, he's always asking me about Socrates and friends. The thing is that book is a very difficult read, I mean, I've been reading all my life and even I struggle to get through it. He's new to reading. So I'm going to get him a study guide for Republic with notes and analysis so it's easier to understand what Plato was talking about, and also get Republic in the Kindle eBook edition. He told me he doesn't like ebooks and prefers paperbacks but Republic is 2500 years old and is available legally for free online in ugly HTML format, and on Amazon you can pick up nicely formatted ebooks of Republic for like $2. The paperbacks are 10x more expensive and I don't want to waste that money when it's available cheaply. The main gift will be the study guide anyway!

ESFP,"ESFPs find making decisions very easy but we don't always make the right ones because we usually just use our gut instinct. INTJs on the other hand mostly like to use logic for every decision. INTJs are thus very bad at making decisions where there is little or no logic involved, such as what to have for lunch. INTJs can get very stressed when there is no obvious choice ie when both options have equal merits and disadvantages. ESFPs make more mistakes because we often just do stuff without really thinking it through and we feel bad when our mistakes hurt others. So like I say less stress more guilt is how it is to feel rather than think."

Why does everything have to be so hard sometimes ... I'm really not that complicated ... I can't continue to go on like this ..

How have you kept a friend for 8+ years? You must have some secret weapons I haven't heard of.     He's an ex, but we have been friends for years. I don't think that matters since we have been friends for longer than we dated (date 2 years, friends 6 years). It's not that I never initiate, sometimes I do. I don't expect him to just know because I have told him it's how I am, using similar phrasing to what you suggested. It's just frustrating because while our friendship allows us to be extremely open with nearly everything (relationships, life, friends, family) and talk about anything, it seems like no matter how many times I express it we spend 5-10 minutes in the beginning of every conversation with me being interrogated for why I've been withdrawn. Sometimes there is no reason. Then, it's  a feedback loop where I withdraw more because I don't feel like being asked why I've been quiet for so long. We're both pretty stubborn too.

I need downtime to reflect, think and grow. It's not personal when I do that to you! It's just who I am. I also prefer that other people initiate conversations.

This is the way I will approach it next time. Thanks. I'm starting to think it's not that he doesn't understand me, it's that I don't understand him, or why he has to question why I've been introverted. It just seems like a major misunderstanding where he thinks something is wrong and there isn't. Nothing's wrong. I'm fine. And I do care, even if it's not expressed in the way he expects. He might judge how much people care based on how much they initiate, which I'm shitty at.

ENFP,"Sent from my SAMSUNG-SGH-I747 using Tapatalk    I recently took Susan Cain introvert test and I actually scored introvert more than most of my introvert friends. . Introvert means you draw your energy internally and work better alone. Extrovert means you draw energy externally and from other people. Enfps tend to fall between both since most enfp enjoy alone time and social events. For example I'm not shy, I can adapt in any social situation , at parties I'm usually the center of attention  - and I'm very friendly , I like public speaking and I love being on stage- however I don't like going out / I have more fun writing or talking to a close friend at a coffee shop, I live in my imagination, I prefer to work alone, and hate team work . Being alone or with a few people makes me happy . It also defer me from being an INFP since I can adapt in social situation . Enfp can be extrovert, ambivert or introverts :) hope that helps"

I also give to charity, volunteer my time, alone, I don't have many deep friends, and I think all of this is because my morals and vision are on the left side of my brain. And the left side deals with seeing parts. Also ESTPs are Doers, we like to get things done, and we have a certain method of doing the task in a sequential order rather than being flexible. Everything that people talk to me about, just rolls off my back and I forget it,literally after the conversation has ended. This produces more conversations, and more forgetful thoughts, and wash and repeat cycle here.     Hmm."

INFP,Yeah when I was in eastern Germany before 1990 when the two halves reunited I could not believe that I'd be living in Ireland now. Things I take for granted like thermostats on the heating elements in the room are not there. The built quality in general is shit. The water is full of chlorine and gives you digestive problems when you drink it. The area is full of litter. Unlike in Germany public waste bins only exist in some spots so people here just drop the packaging when they are done with it. Living here for some time I kind of can filter this out and get used to it. Still I know that things can be done better and are done better in many places in the world. But I feel helpless in doing anything about it. There are so many issues to address  I don't know where to start.
ISFP,"Yep usually I have awkward faces when she does that. It's always surprising when she praises me because it's like a sudden thing, out of nothing, and I need a few seconds to make sense of it.

Usually I feel more comfortable with something that happens in a specific context because it is easier for me to make sense of it and to understand why it happens. "

But recently, I made an effort to at least smile at her and say ""Hi"" while passing by as I've come to regard it as something people in like class sections do as a matter of courtesy.

But after that, I realized that I was letting my mother control and manipulate me. I don't think she was aware of it--this was her biggest weakness. She depended on her children, for them to give her emotional stability, rather than being that emotional rock for us. It was, to be honest, pathetic. I didn't understand that for another 30 years or more, but I _felt_ it. After my fiasco, and realizing I was still alive, I realized that I didn't need to allow her to determine my reaction. To put a single word on it, I forgave her--internally. And to be honest, I've had to return to that multiple times. "

I had legitimately drunk too much earlier in the day with the people I was with so I was glad to give up the reigns.  But as the night grew long, and I along w/ the others started to sober up.

If I need to solve a problem, I'm probably going to consult just the right person to get it done, or learn the bare minimum to cover it. That's another difference - ESFPs are more likely to use their human resources (ask someone) when they need to figure something out. ESTPs can be more self-reliant in that regard. Te also differs from Ti in that way; Te-users only give a shit about what is currently relevant to getting what they want in a given situation."

I have experienced heart-break, death, depression, enlightenment, revelation, and a change in spiritual belief. My constant search for inner and outer knowledge has not changed yet the path to obtain this has wavered and been manipulated in a multitude of ways through my life.

ENFJ,Everything finally makes sense. My biggest fear was not being able to protect my loved ones. I faced that ultimate failure and collapsed. No faith in myself or anyone. I felt absolutely worthless. It felt like: what's the point of doing anything? I couldn't save her. I couldn't help her. I couldn't.

I didn't bring it up because it would seem like I was fishing for compliments, and I dunno, but I thought maybe she didn't like it or I offended her somehow. Now, I'm not looking for a love fest, but given she's definitely ISFJ, I did expect a simple ""thank you"" to acknowledge the thought/effort. "

ESFJ,Would you be able to make this thread sticky for us? Many thanks in advance.    Wish granted.
INTP,"Think about it. You never experience it, so you don't know what it's like. While you're asleep, your consciousness -- which is the only think that links your mind (whatever it may be) to the world around you -- is turned off and instead flooded with random data that usually has just a little to do with the world around you. You can't consciously perform the action of falling asleep, you can only do it ""accidentally"" if your body chooses to do so for you. You can't even necessarily wake yourself up unless your body decided to do so for you, usually because of some sort of physical input to your body."
ENFJ,"@SilentScream  That's very much how I deal with really difficult things  as well, (feel nothing at first, and actually start feeling things  months later, it's kind of like I'm just in crisis mode for a while and  everything's turned off) I agree with Happy about Nothing. in that it's  actually a good sign that you're starting to feel these things. (Another  way I think of it is kind of like when someone is very badly physically  injured, at first the adrenaline cuts out the pain, and then after a  while they suddenly start to feel everything. I think emotions can work  in a similar way, though the term they work that way in is just over a  larger scale). "
ENFP,PS: Would it make you ladies more comfortable if it were gay men discussing sex? (retroactive clarification question)    Are you? 
INTJ,"If she dealt with that screwed up a family - well you know what they say about bullies? 'Never let them see you cry.' You don't want to look like a weak target. Or maybe she say a lot of unhealthy emotional manipulation through tears. Or saw her mother so unhappy and so dysfunctional in that relationship and doesn't want to be like her. Or saw her father react to emotional upset with violence and doesn't want to be like him. Or maybe she had to be ""the grown up"" in some ways before she should and part of that is being 'strong for others.' Or maybe it's because, compared to what she dealt with, little things don't deserve tears and she thinks she is being ridiculous for reacting to things so much less intense than what she dealt with with her family. Or a history of emotional invalidation. Or, very Fi, it's just not anyone's business unless they are very very close. Or some combination of these (and this list is by no means comprehensive). "

I go to a couple of those, mainly around American football, because that's what I do. I'm open to chatting most places, if someone else initiates the conversation, so that would be lunch in the park, getting a coffee, in the gym, between reps, or before I start, or finish.

However, if they are pretty consistent in their attitude towards me I eventually get the hint they don't like me much. Somehow I still don't take that personally. I just shrug it off and move on cause I know there's other people who are interested in talking to me. With other people I guess I just keep giving a benefit of the doubt to them, so I never like to make a firm judgement that they may not like me until the bad reactions come from them fairly consistently."

ENTP,"Originally Posted by drmiller100   anything worth doing is worth doing sober.    In my experience, sobriety is highly overrated. Of course, I was a sailor."
ENTJ,"If you look at our responses in threads about relationships and other things, you will find that maturity and the traits related to it are very very important to us. Because it results in efficiency and smooth sailing when all involved are mature. Now if it was the chicken or the egg first I don't know but we either are mature because we value the traits or we value the traits because we are mature."
ENTJ,"That being said, I wouldn't open with ""does anyone play minecraft..."" You're really better off under some other type if you want people with time for that."
ESTJ,"They have this delusion that you're an incompetent, stupid fool and that they know SO much better than you what to do. They use this as an excuse to be bossy."
INFP,it. I dont want him to end up in a bad place so I don't call the cops
INTP,"Originally Posted by BlondeRJ   I'm synesthetic.  I taste a couple words, but mostly assign colors, genders, and personalities to every letter and number.  I also read and write backwards (I type 50 words per minute backwards) and can write mirror with my left hand while writing correctly with my right hand at the same time.  All synesthetic things.  :-)  It's fascinating.    I've always associated Wednesdays with blue. But man, that's crazy! Couldn't Leonardo da Vinci do the both-hands thing? Synesthesia is so cool."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Wellsy   Do ENFPs always have a side of them, a inner secret kind of thing that's reserved only for those deemed worthy of such trust?    Not consciously, I don't think.  The way I see it, intentional mystery is a form of mind game, and I don't like those.  So I am who I am, everywhere, all the time.  But I think everybody has secrets, and not everybody would be capable of dealing with someone like me in all my ENFP-like glory, so I try to hold back a little, just a little.  I'm my own true self everywhere, but I don't always express it with the same intensity, in all contexts.  "
ESTP,"But seriously the most I've ever had an ESTP male do was tolerate me (obviously at that) or flash me  grin when smashed.  <--Mkes me sound interested.  Trust me, this lesbian, was not."
ISFJ,Can breath easily now.. I'm happy with the way our friendship goes.. still very concern with him but because I knew bits of this type I am more passive..
ISFP,-I've realized that it's become almost impossible for me to develop an intimate relationship with someone.
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by serendipitous   Are INTJs known for making rash generalisations?    I am aware that there are minor differences in details and there are exceptions to every rule, but my job is to find patterns amidst the chaos, to see the major trends in things. Many people refuse to see patterns. My job is to see the essence of things and not let minor exceptions get in the way."

ESTP,"Assuming her friend was an innocent bystander, I'd be apologetic and see if I could help. If she continues to ignore me, I move on. Unless I had a reason another reason to stay, she's made it clear I'm not wanted here.    Hm, it was not on purpose. He did something stupid, which ended up in an (car) accident. I'd say that girl who was in the car wasn't totally innocent herself, but the one that's angry blame everything on him (seemingly)."

INFP,I should be out having fun. My friend tells me it's sweet that I take my mom's feelings into consideration.
INFJ,"I should charge money for all the INTJ interpreting I do.  Good grief, these non INTJ kids keep me busy, lol.  It's also interesting how incredibly similar all the breaks up are to mine.  Certainly seems to be a definite pattern in the way things come apart.  I also find it quite interesting that they find me helpful, lol, cuz... well, it's me, lol.  And that they seem to find me?

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by hello317   Haha. Yeah, I think you should go if there was one before you leave. You deserve it."

INFP,Brain is just white noise.    Yes I relate.  The brain likely is not producing enough serotonin.
ESFP,"Me: "" Are you sure? :/ you know I'm always here to listen if your upset. Nothing really, I was just waiting for your reply, you?""    Don't ask the ""are you sure?"" question.  At least I know I hate that.  It's like, what did I just say?  Why would I lie to you about that?  =P"
INFJ,"Some dreams I have are just strange or involve me dying quick, but nightmares that are intense and creepy and describe my fears, anxiety causers, my shadow, and what I refer to as my ""dead side"" all in one go... I don't know if I'll sleep tonight, I don't want another nightmare to pop up."
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Big Daddy Kane   My entp friend keeps spamming me with stupid texts. I find this irritating. I also feel like not replying to someone when they have sent like 20 messages is rude. But what can I say? There's nothing worth replying to. As far as I know I am like an outlet for his silly Ne shit, because I'm tolerant and patient and won't tell him to fuck off, while I'm pretty sure everyone else will."
ENTP,"Ti is internal logic, and if you watch, Ti people like to hone their Ti by debate and arguing.  When you combine Ti with Ne, you get someone who can switch sides, and argue from multiple sides of an issue, and it makes it ""fun."" "
ENFP,"Originally Posted by fguewriter   You sounded so jokey and humorous, talking to @AyaSullivan that way.    This is text, so the tone is kinda subjective. "
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Whippit   I hate to be the dissenter, but I don't think it's completely true for me. At least, I mean, my hidden secrets are personal. Not personal to me, but personal to you.I won't tell you that one thing that gives you access to me until I trust you, though I may easily tell someone else that I don't think is capable of accessing me.    What's funny is, I never tell anyone anything with an expectation that it will remain with them. Often, when I reveal a 'hidden' part of myself to others (even the smallest morsel) they are so quick to tell others and then try to draw a conclusion about it. It is hilarious to me. Some people have described ENFP's as controlling. In a way, I am controlling them by spoon-feeding them pieces of me. Yet, that is not the objective. I do, however, test people as a way to protect myself from dealing with the type of Fe I hate. That is only if I can not 'grade' a person via observation. Once I finally trust you, you will probably feel like, ""meh"". As my brother likes to say, ""Get over yourself."""
ESTP,"Having a right to emotion, to feel, is something you cannot take away from people - even if you try."

ENFJ,"His gf broke up with him (he saw it coming). Still is going to continue sleeping with her - from the way it looks he's going to approach it, all I can see is the whole thing ending in tears. Never enter these things as you cling onto old feelings. Set clear boundaries. Know when to call the damn thing quits. If you can succeed in doing this, you might just have a chance of coming out the other side of the whole damn mess unscathed. "
ISFP,"I'll add as well that not only is this time of year usually rough for a lot of people, for different reasons, but also the political climate across the modern world is rough. Straining economies, heavily divided political parties and a battle between nationalism and globalism, these are heavy things. It takes a lot to maintain a positive outlook with this kind of stuff going on. Just saying.    Wanna go bowling?"
ESFJ,"I think it partially occurs due to the fact that we often mistype people online due to this whole iNtuitive superiority circle jerk thing. Which is completely dumb and inaccurate, as sensors are just as intelligent and often can be very creative, they're just reality focused."
ENFP,Originally Posted by Aya Nikopol   Motivate others.    Really? are you guys good public speakers then?

ESTJ,"Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go via the parents seeing that she values their opinion strongly and want to do things 'the right way'. I can relate to that as my dad who is ESTJ (and Christian) would prefer to see relationships of his children happen with his consent or at least with some kind of involvement from him. Maybe she feels she let her parents down and herself as it went too fast. I'm not saying you should propose, but rather somehow make contact with them in some way that makes her feel more at ease with the situation."
ENFP,"Honestly I know the solution is to just get a job, I figured a little back story may be necessary though, but my question still remains, how can a ENFP deal with a ESTJ unwilling to even compromise, there is a lot more bad blood between them but at this point my BF is trying so hard to forgive his step father, and his step father just thinks he is always in the right.    My mom is an ESTJ and my brother is an ESTJ so I have some experience dealing with them. It isn't always easy. Has your bf tried explaining logically why it is important for him to stay. ESTJs first function is Te. It is our tertiary. If your boyfriend has been getting emotional while he's tried to explain it, that could be part of his problem. Also, you may want to prove to the ESTJ that you guys aren't just goofing off together. Maybe come over yourself and let him see you guys studying together. "

ISTP,"We had that thing on 2009, and Jesus Christ, it started making me uncomfortable as fuck. That was it, I accept we had that fling, but in 2013 I had no interest at all to stay in contact with her."
INTP,"One of these days, I expect compensation for the mental anguish I was caused in my youth. That compensation will come in the form of a large supply of hot chocolate, some oreos, a log cabin on the outskirts of society, a fireplace, and a couple of good books."

ESFP,"I have a friend(?) that I've known for about 3 years now. For the past several months his communication tends to consist  of randomly calling me and then ignoring me for weeks. And then being like oh dude where you been? and then proceeding to ignore me again. Thing is, these random call/texts don't even last an entire conversation! I'm introverted and easily distracted, so I can go a while without communication, and I try to be nice, friendly, entertaining, easy-going... but I feel like either his attention span is retarded or he's just trying to prove that he can still get a reaction out of me, like maintaining a harem or something. The last one went like so:"
ESFP,"Do ESFPs ever hit a point?  This girl can display anger more than I ever could.  So I was a huge target for depression.  Seems like this girl can actually throw a punch or get physical when she is upset.  I don't know what is better.  I don't think she has it within her to actually really hurt someone else.  I'm more worried about her unvalidated psyche. At this point, I don't think she even is aware that she deserves to be validated. "
ENTJ,"She said today, ""I'm one of the most judgemental people"". She's extroverted, definitely, I thought she was ESTJ, but she said she's not. She got her hair dyed red which is something I don't think SJs would do."

ISTP,Nothing bores me in this world except other people.
INFJ,"Fuck I am seriously so sorry for all the times I doubted your awesomeness or got annoyed at how you analyse everything to the millionth degree. You are such a wonderful person, it's just a damn shame I can't tell you that without you asking me for a detailed reason as to why I think that. :|"

If it's a place where you cannot dance, we just talk and after a while I start suggesting games because I get bored. Games like one person can say a word and the other has to go up to a stranger and hit on them using that word (this can be so much fun haha) or we make a competition: One girl says what kind of guy she likes and we others have 5 minutes to scan the bar and come back with suitable candidates for her.

Generally I am judged by my results, by things I do, by facts and not by how I am perceived. I'll give you an example, since I was mentioning my MBO evaluation. The general manager used to wonder why I am looking all the time outside the window in the direction of the air conditioning fans. What do I find so interesting about those?!  Of course there is nothing interesting about those, I was day dreaming and using that direction as a focus point. My mind was completely somewhere else. Made a note to myself, stop staring outside the window, stare at the laptop, it makes me look more clever, or at least like I'm working.  However it seems it does not work, my direct manager mentioned in my evaluation that it seems sometimes that I am somewhere else with my mind and unfocused. What can I say, damned INFP dreamer look, I can't seem to escape it...so I'm not really fooling anybody.  This however actually helps me work better and I could explain why, in detail, but it's not relevant, what is relevant is that I have always had good evaluations, I have received promotions, new tasks, increases in pay etc because it works, because  I do a good job and I am appreciated for that.

ENFJ,"Empty, used, hurt.  I'm really down right now from never being able to find someone that accepts me >< I feel like something is wrong with me so much for other people that are cruel to get to have decent relationships yet I cannot.  I've only once been told back by someone I love that they love me and I didn't realize the relationship was abusive until afterworlds(she drained 10% of my bank account on the first date as one example), People always walk all over me and judge me ><, I think i'm quite ugly to be honest as people tend to avoid me after looking at me ><, I just generally have a hard time with how my life is moving right now I'm past just being lonely.."
ENTP,"@Obv  don't give her false hopes ; maybe her arguments were stupid and he's hurt because he still shamefully wants to bang her.    I was only facilitating conversation and moving past the awkwardness of the fact she likely tried to be clear that he wasn't going to bang her, but he still had his hopes up, then got all pissy when he didn't get what he wanted. She said she wanted to keep him around..."

ISTJ,"So, what's going on? I admit the first two times we ran into each other in the elevator, I was going through some tough times of my own and wasn't in a talking mood. On the first encounter, I got the impression she was hoping I'd initiate a convo judging from the few times she glanced over at me. On the third time several days ago, I just did my 5 seconds of saying ""Hi"" and idle small talking. "
ENTJ,"1. Because the INTJ was not impressed, could I risk going over her head to show the ENTJ what I've done?"
ISFP,Originally Posted by fattyj   That's cool that you're amazed by it! Is it common for other ISFPs to appreciate Ne or ENFPs to appreciate your Fi/Se function (or whatever it is)? Because it seems we both really do!

ESFJ,"- When you feel sadness in life to a degree of wanting to shoot yourself, but then when you feel happiness it's like you see sparkles and fairies in the air and the world is like the musical and birds are singing chibilibu"
ISFJ,"no seriously, sometimes i think this     I'm an INFJ, and I would rather have your good qualities than mine. I am always trying to be more like my husband. Our kids always turn to him when they need someone because he is so nurturing. It makes me jealous! I always try to give them advice when they just want someone to listen. There are so many other areas, like I want to be as giving as he is and as thoughtful."
ENTJ,So guess my question is in extreme anger do ur emotions interfere with ur rational thought process?
ENFP,I can't imagine if she's going to pull anything... the part of me that's got my own back is telling me this isn't going to be as good as I'm hoping.
ENTJ,"1) Be yourself. INTPs are my kryptonite, though it's not the same with all ENTJs."
ISTP,"Edit: FYI, I ended up having sex anyway, and it was fucking fantastic."
ENFP,On Netflix I'm liking Arrow and Reign right now. New 24 just started up and looks good too.
INFP,"I explained it to her... she knows that I am super shy and all but like most people she just thinks that if we do it many times we get used to it. I have done these things many times, I know I don't die but I also know that I will not get used to this feeling or stop being nervous about it. It might have worked on some people but that doesn't mean that it will work on me. I have acted in a play or I was forced to be on a play in elementary school and stuff. It hasn't become any better.

INTP,I like that picture in your signature. Not sure but it looks like a cross between Abe Lincoln and Albert Einstein?
INFJ,"Hello again, @Juggernaut. Looks like you got some great answers from the posts above.  You may find your best connections/developing close bonds with open minded intellectuals.  I read that the INTP is the perfect type to help INFJ develop their Ti.  The only INTP I know is through Per C and I admire her immensely.  I can see how INFJ & INTP interactions would be a very helpful and enriching alignment for both.  "
ISFP,"Or maybe she'll decide to be condescending and use guilt trips, and try to act like she didn't do anything wrong and that I'm just some hedonistic ingrate slut who hates the kind, calm, self-sacrificial person that she used to be, that she still could be. I hate to even think about how awful it will be, but staying is worse. Because I can't move on with her anger spewing into my ears all day all the time, never a moment's peace. I guess having her be gone this weekend let me relax too much amd remember to enjoy life and not feel angry again."
ESTJ,I have to actually convince them by saying 'A true leader is also a good follower' just to persuade them to behave better.
ESFP,"The thing is that until a relationship becomes ""serious"". I'm aware that I need to keep my options open and so until I have to close all other doors I'm not going to. You can call it immoral and all if you want but too many times relationships just don't work out for whatever reason and the other person or I might not commit. Closing all doors is a death trap into depression for someone who is as relationship heavy as me. "
ENFJ,"me too, been sick and alone with my two year old. I feel kinda ugly and fat today too, lol. you aren't alone!"
ESFJ,Sure! Go for it if you have those kind of magic powers to make it happen :)
INFP,ha! And I was just coming here to complain about people who don't know the difference between plural and possessive.

Really all I need to do is get it over and done with and send out a few applications (instead of one every few weeks :x), but every time I resolve to I am put off by the process. I'm so silly."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by stripedfurball   Nooooo, it was a legitimate attempt to figure out how best to terrorize my ten year old niece.

Lol, what makes you think you'll do any better than her parents? "
INFP,"I'm sitting in a little study area at my college waiting for my sister to get out of class and pondering groups..well kind of. what draws certain people to each other, that kind of thing. and I'm also thinking about this essay I have to write in english. It's a persuasive paper I'm having issue with because my thoughts don't seem solid or orderly. I want to write a paper persuading the reader that America is an ignorant country but I don't really know how to do that because I also want to talk about ways to make Americans not as ignorant and also share some of my fascination with how other countries employ american culture and language (heard Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga playing in the background of a korean drama and in a Chinese movie called Yiyi two businessmen (one japanese and one chinese) communicated by using english). I guess I want america to appreciate other cultures and others appreciate ours. But all that i want to write about kind of jumps around and I don't know if it would make sense in a persuasive paper and i'm worried it might sound more like an informational paper. "
ESTP,"It's funny. It almost feels like we are of the same mindset, he just doesn't have the ""What If"" scenarios running through his head the way I do. Classic SP vs. NT?"
INFJ,"Don't feel any motivation at all.  I did go buy essentials a bit ago... I've been putting that off for two weeks, at least.  Blah. "
ISFJ,"Just wondering because I get really confused about differences in Ni and Si.    I'm good at remembering certain things, usually details about a place or situation if that detail caught my attention. I'm kinda crap at remembering other things. It feels like my memory zeros in on some things and just lets other things whoooosh by. I rely on lists and reminders so I don't forget the things I need to remember."
ESFP,"sometimes, i replay scenes with a vengeance and i get physical "
INFP,"Alternatively, it makes me sad I don't get to see them regularly- or at all."
ISTP,"Have you tried a small business? Despite supporting small business, when it comes to tires, they have always been the best and cheapest service I've ever had, across the country.

ENTJ,Do that and observe the difference it makes in your interactions.
ENTP,IE: Women with larger breasts or hips are considered favorable because these features prove for a healthy breeder.
ENFP,"Originally Posted by ai.tran.75   I think correct me Enfps if I'm wrong being a feeler means you're emotionally intelligent , I too don't like being touch, avoid emotional outburst, never cry in front of anyone. I think we can put a person or ourself at ease if conflict or emotion arises to us . "
ENTJ,This goal has to be a year long goal. Anything shorter will make you question yourself. 
ENFP,"B. Everyone has their own definition of love.  Obviously, there will be people who have the same or similar definitions of love, and I am well aware that my definition of love will not be everybody's definition of love. You should also be aware of this. For me, it means everything to me if someone genuinely understands me as a person. To me, that is love. I don't want much from people; basically I just want to feel respected by any given person, and I am satisfied.  The rest I can deal with.  Everybody sees things differently.  Not every single person in the whole world has one definition of love, so you can't tell me you disagree with any one person's definition; that doesn't make any sense.  "
INTJ,"I don't need alone time to figure out my feelings or opinions about it, most of the times even if the given circumstances are different the core issue is something I already encountered or theorically considered so I know where I stand. "

INTP,"Ok, pet peeve time.  If you bastards are going to use ""per se"", at least us it correctly.  It means ""taken alone"" or ""by itself"" or ""without anything more"" or ""inherently"".  "

ENTP,"If everytime an ENTP walked by or talked talked to an INFJ male and his testes cried out in longing, what would you do/say?"
ISTJ,"And I can hold my thoughts alright. Its just takes more effort to do so. Think of it as a river with fast currents or treacherous ocean with big waves. Sure, you can try to restrain one wave/ flow of the curent for a while. But it takes effort. And doing so would block all the previous waves that are coming.

ENTP,"The main sexual fantasy of power hungry people is to lose said power.    You do know that men used to wear heels before women did. It was a symbol of power and status. Not unsimilar to padded shoulders in suits. According to your logic then, they wanted to be stripped of their manliness. Is that what you mean? So the next time I see a football player in a padded jersey, I should assume he is wearing that jersey because he wants to be pummeled and reduced to a sobbing mess? If I see a CEO wearing an expensive watch, I should assume he wants to be mugged and humiliated? I wouldn't say only the second half of your answer is sarcastic. I hope your entire comment is sarcastic, or you're just sexist and insensitive to the topic of rape. No one should be raped ever, regardless of what they are or aren't wearing. A woman wearing a miniskirt to show off her legs is no different than a man going topless to show off his pecs/abs."

INTP,"Also, is PerC pronounced ""Percy""? That's what I think, now. I almost typed in percyscafe.com a while ago.    The media doesn't care if a woman has talent at what she does as long as she's conventionally attractive and half-naked. Women are just like men in that they are individuals, but the media doesn't really have the intelligent or progressivism to actually acknowledge this fact most of the time."

INFP,"To ne honest, I nearly feel as though I'm crying on the inside within my heart on what is seemingly a daily basis, although I generally don't express it much towards most other beings. I'll predominantly attempt to maintain a congenial and calming demeanor to convey towards those I encounter throughout a daily basis and try to provide them with words of encouragement and optimism, but I still can't deny nonetheless that the internal turmoil I feel is still rpesent, whether I attempt to neglect and conquer it or not. It isn't so much that I feel worthless to those within humanity or that I believe I'm unable to relate towards other persons, for it is generally quite the opposite with my empathetic nature, but more or so that I just feell...alone. I visualize how other beings encompassing me are constantly developing and attaining their dreams, in addition towards finding love and happiness with another, and, while I feel genuine pleasure at seeing so many individuals becoming content with their obtainments, I still can help but question myself on why I can't be that jubilant person myself, why I can't be at peace with my own self and surroundings with the gifts I have been granted by the world that encircles in the mannerism I wish. There are but so many things that I just happen to sincerely loathe concerning my own self at this given moment, such as my lack of assertion and self-confidence, and additional awkward and uncertain nature, and as much as I yearn on what is seemingly a daily basis to emerge and blossom past my insecurites and transcend my own self,it still feels towards me as though I am static, lacking in growth and quality that deems me a person worth admiring and respecting. I wish I didn't feel such horrid thoughts and beliefs and that I could somehow be able to acquire serenity with my own self, and yet I somewhow cannot, for those vicious, pessimistic thoughts and beliefs and consequently eating away at my soul and attempting to pollute it. "
INFP,"Why do I do this.  My friends are going to start noticing and think I'm disgusting and psycho.

ENFP,"How close is Anna to how you view ENFPs?      There has been a debate about whether she is INFP or ENFP. I think shes INFP myself, I mean she spoke to the paintings when bored lol, fell in love so quickly believing it to be true love and of course set out to talk to her sister, seeing it as her fault. Plus she didnt want to dance that much, quirky old guy.....lol I think INFP becuase of the talking to paintings thing, which we tend to do A LOT (speak and give inanimate objects names feelings and stuff), and because she described the sky as being awake. I may be wrong in saying INFP are most known for that, because i think ENFPs are too? but I think shes one of us :3. Also, i think an ENFP would try to escape from the castle instead of staying, and she stayed with her sister instead. Could be wrong though. :) She also did not give up on her sister, even when struck by her, and helped her to realize what she needed in the end too. We are known for that, but ENFPs are too."

ISFJ,"Well, I usually understand those moments I have in terms of my mental health issues (mostly my anxiety and social anxiety) so didn't think it would be applicable to MBTI but seems I can relate to him.  I guess how it works is something makes me confident enough to express my Fe/Ne, eg. the sugar, the alcohol, getting fed up of having to restrain myself and follow rules and eventually snapping from it, and it gets sort of out of control.  Then I have a ""come down"" and go back to my normal restrained/reserved person and get embarrassed of my actions.  I don't know if you've ever experienced this with drinking alcohol - where you go out and have fun then the next day you're full of regret.  It sort of feels like that.  Being drunk off your extraverted functions lol.  And Fe especially is a bitch because you're worried how you've come across, if it was appropriate, was it really you saying/doing those things, sometimes it feels like being possessed by someone you don't know.."

INTJ,"The only thing they learn in school is how to obey orders and not think by themselves, it would be easier to destroy the system and start again from scratch than trying to improve the current one.    I believe I've heard of that book before (or something similar), but haven't read it, I'll have to bookmark it for myself, thanks. I also have some pretty strong opinions on the educational system, among other things of course. I share the same sentiments on the obeying issue, the whole design is outdated, like many systems we have in place currently. I think one of the main things I would love to implement, is the ability to critically think about ideas in an open forum and challenging those ideas openly and honestly in order to aide the progression of knowledge, etc. Getting children at an early age to critically think instead of obeying and following orders. There is a serious lack of critical thinking going on in educational institutions. I also believe a lot of systems are built upon a ""one size fits all"" model and when that is deeply ingrained within the establishment of education, you are going to have a much harder time to bring about change, at least in the real sense because it doesn't allow for adaptation, or movement within the framework, it becomes stagnate."

I waited in the recovery room on my own, feeling a little lonely, anxious, sore, thirsty, worried...just waiting for you to come back. And the corridor outside was busy with people walking up and down, but as your dad brought you to me, I could hear your cry and I never heard it before...but I knew it was you before I saw you...thats just occured to me now! And your dad says that as he carried you to me you were crying, but as soon as you heard my voice you stopped and listened and your face took on a look of wonder...you knew my voice too. And then your dad put you in my arms and OH I will never forget that moment, the happiest of my life...I held you and you gripped my finger and looked up at me with such focus and I just loved every bit of you.

ENTJ,"It's all on the basis of economics, terrorist aside, but look at death tolls from Syria compared to what Russia and Germany lost in the world wars and you can see how much of a fart in the wind terrorism is compared to true war.    then again the number of deaths in ww2 is a relatively large fart in the wind compared to the increasing population."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Caged Within   ENFPs I know tend to be people that love to laugh and smile. Are any of y'all like that?    Yes, I'm told my laugh is infectious."
ESTP,"I do over-think ... but not when something needs to be done. Then I'm all about the action. I will over-think when things are nice and comfortable and life is coasting along just fine. I get spurred into action when something dramatic happens that needs me to become active immediately. I think age matters here as well. I was a lot crazier when I was younger. The whole point of understanding MBTI though has been to overcome the weaker aspects of my personality. Risk-taking, lack of future planning was one of those. "
ISTJ,"*shrug* I don't have much more than time right now.    Using a camera and a telescope, my dad took a picture of the moon at the exact same time every night for a month straight."
ENFP,this could just be him trying to get his opinions out or making sure he is portrayed the right way.
ENFP,"I seem to have quite some drama with my F friends (INFJs & INFPs) lately. They can be great friends and be on the same wave lenght as me but sometimes their F is too much drama and annoys me. I never ever had this problem with my INTP, ESTJ, ENTP and ESTP friends. So I'm thinking it must be the T that prevents them from going all drama about small things. They are also okay with not being in contact for a while and then when we see each other, it's as great as ever. They never reproach to you that you're not staying in contact enough or that you take two dayd to reply to texts sometimes."
ENTP,"But this puts you in a bit of a pickle...either I'm a female INFJ posing as a male, in which case you must divulge your secret. OR your statement is wrong and I will have the answer from a female.    Jness? What is a Jness? Is that like a clitoris?"
ISTJ,"I'm really used to living with introverts ever since I was born. It seems that next year I will be the only introvert in the house. I'm interested what kind of experience that will be. In addition, one of my best friends is an introvert and he's going to be gone next year. So there will be no introvert to escape to. I'm going to have to re-friend an introvert who I broke ties with against my will."
ENFP,"What attracts you to approach an introvert initially if you happen to notice us, or would you not? Assume no forced social obligation, purely encountering us out in the wild, not at school or work."

Just those callous, contrary NT types. Lol. "
ENTJ,"I wonder how much Ni helps with this kind of stuff, or do you think you use Ti way of reasoning instead?    I'd like to say that I'm good at improvising logical explanations when needed, and I do it with 'umph'. "
ENTP,"-Ob.    I've worked for a few ENTJs, dated a few and have a few friends/ family members. My relationship with ENTJs is a very strong dynamic of power and anger. We often work well together and can really make progress in any project we decide to take on, and often have great conversations and fun together. But the extremely aggressive and often abrasive nature of ENTJs makes me tend to challenge them, which pisses them off. Sometimes I manage to strike a harmonious balance with ENTJ family or lovers who are less hot tempered, so it really depends on the individual person."
ENFP,The answer is no; they're animals and part of the food chain. Part of my food chain. I could be part of theirs' too. Do I place the value of person higher than an animal? Yes.

We have to figure out ""logistics"" :( It's beyond emotional comprehension for me. He is nice and I don't want to hurt him at all, but I can't do this any longer - it's like losing my feet. It's not an option for me. I also might be losing my mind to imaginative coping techniques."
ISFP,"We actually have a lot of similar things together, that is, if we disregard our individual ways of judging matters. :P"
ENFJ,"Problem is I cant stand by and just watch it  happen. If I give him a number to call he wont call it, and I dont  think hell understand self help. I mean he's still very young anyway, he's not  gonna know about being completely independent and helping yourself. Theres NO thing that will get through his parents. So  I'm really debating this. Because once he hits 18+ since thats when  problems peak, for who knows how long. Years and years, or a life time.    I think you need to talk to your brother about his options (child services, counseling, etc) and the two of you should make a decision together."
ESTP,"For example: My ESTP friend didn't work on her skit we had all week to design for Theatre class when we were in high school. So, she would do one of two things: Make up an excuse to get out of it or just get up and make it up as she went along. The skit that she made up on stage got the most credit. Her teacher thought she had spent days working on it when in reality it was made up on the spot."

It's one of the reasons why you guys are my favorite personality type, and I wish that I could be more like all of you. I like learning how you guys think, since your strengths are my weaknesses - my ENTJ isn't the only reason why I frequent the ENTJ forums; they're good places for learning and self-improvement."

ISFJ,"You know your an ISFJ when you send a text message, then throw your phone to the other side of the room, or intentionally leave it in a different room so you are not constantly looking at your phone to see if you got a reply."
INFJ,"But it has been a rough Thanksgiving. My son (he's in his thirties) gets abusive when he drinks and I've made the decision not to be around him for a while. My husband and I had Thanksgiving Dinner on our own - that was fine, I enjoyed him and the meal. But I so wish things could be different. I think my son is probably out there thinking ""Why doesn't my family include me on this day that's supposed to be about families?"" And I think he's blaming me, because he blames me for EVERYTHING. I am trying to remind myself of the Buddhist instruction for peace: accepting things as they are. But I can't help feeling sad about it all ... (and reminding myself accepting that is part of accepting things as they are, too ...)"
ENFJ,Definitely face your fear of horses. They can be awesome.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by PianoWizzy   A quick, small question."
ISFP,"Of course, that could easily come in the form less like, ""Will you go out with me?"" and more like, ""So, are you going to ask me out? Or what?"""
ENFP,"The best advice I can give with the information I have is that you should approach him and ask why he treats you the way he does.  Make it clear to him that you acknowledge that you aren't the best at communicating diplomatically, and ask him if he dislikes you.  If he is in fact an ENFP, he will likely respond well to that.  (Unless he's as immature as he seems, in which case he's not worth salvaging a relationship with if you don't need the relationship.)"
ESTP,"Just to see how similar it is to my type. Territorial much?     I could care less if you come into the forum, but clearly you weren't an ESTP and you were writing as if you were."

I put the cat inside and took the mouse into the woods next to some underbrush covered in berries so it would have food if it healed from the small injuries it had (he was exhausted, but looked like he could move ok), and my family just rolled their eyes because ""cat's kill mice and that's the way nature works"". And i really do understand that, but when i see it happening in front of me i can't help myself but to do something to stop it, and people think I'm foolish. "
ISFP,"Well, I usually find many things attractive in my life, but often afraid to get attach to."
ISFJ,"me, me, me! So...I just broke up with my ISFJ bf. (1 of the first things I made him do was take the test.) I'm ENFP.  The thing is, I really still care about him, but i felt that I needed to break up with him because I felt that he was losing interest in the relationship. (We have a 10-year gap. So I guess I wanted to give him space to think about what he wants in life.) He was hesitant about the break-up but I insisted. We still talk, but I do want some kind of direction to the relationship. He said he doesn't want to lose me as a friend. Do ISFJs really take time to commit fully or maybe he just really wants me as a friend?"
INFP,"why am i always just silently empathiectic, why is it so hard to say""that i can understand how you feel and i care"" why do i feel like it isn't enough to care that i have to help people with their problems. why does it feel so wrong to take action? my life is so devoid of risk that nothing really good or bad happens to me.there so much i can't even express-i have that feeling of speechless-ness in my throat even though i'm typing.."

ISFP,"On the other hand, people like to blame interpersonal conflict on the other person (he's unhealthy so we can't have a good relationship, or it's her fault I'm this way--she's unhealthy). We live, today in a culture of victimization, where everybody else is responsible for how we are, how we feel and how we behave, but we never are. But that is not how it works. Nobody else can _make_ us do anything we don't actually want to. Nobody can really make you angry, or resentful. (actually, the anger part is not entirely true--the original flash of anger may be an instinctual reaction, but the further behavior--that's under our control). "
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Scarlet.Black   How does your Fi effect your life? :)    My dad is an ESTJ and he goes through relationships the same way I go through sensory stimuli when I'm stressed, and he can be extremely sensitive about his values when I challenge them extensively (as in pulling out the corner stone and tearing down every counter argument, in an attempt to see where it'll take us) with logic."
ISFJ,"-you have problems contacting someone because you don't want to come off as too desperate, so you keep putting it off until you have grown apart from them and would feel awkward contacting them out of the blue."

ESTJ,"1. What kind of traditions do you like to follow (if any)? I know us SJ's are stereotyped as being conservative and traditional, but I feel for me It's more of what I grew up with than what society considered traditional. is it the same for you? Do you have family traditions?    Tradition/al is a much abused and misunderstood term around here. What it actually refers to is not family or cultural traditions, but an SJ's general inclination to not try something new for newness' sake. If a method or system works, they're not going to break it for the hell of it."
ENFP,"I will say that it is VERY difficult and sometimes frustrating when I cannot engage them in heart to heart conversations or elicit serious advice or sympathy (the latter may be rare because of your aux-Fi and my weak Fe I realize).  Wheneve we go from fun topics to serious ones, things just kind of stop."
ESFP,"ESTP and ESFP social dynamics differ as well as a result of their judging differences. ESTPs tend to charge through social situations, bringing people with them and causing collateral damage, often unbeknownst to them. Their personal relationships can be very messy. That's true of ESFPs too, but ESTPs can be so clueless about the art of getting close to people that they may feel totally unlovable deep down, or disregard vulnerability entirely due to having the shittiest Fi possible. If ESFPs are gonna fuck up their relationships, we tend to get vulnerable with people and bond deeply, then get pissed by something they do and blow them off in a dramatic rage (which we can sometimes forget a week later, depending on the severity of the ""betrayal"", lol). ESFPs are considerably more inconsistent than ESTPs. ""Tempestuous emotions"" are sort of a trademark (I'm fairly certain I've read that on a Socionics page too). ESTPs get very pissed too, but it takes them longer, and it's usually for a good reason if they do. I think we tend to be ""moodier"". We're more likely to sit and wallow in our sadness/anger/what have you and do something irrational out of the blue. I often find my ESTP saying shit like ""you're so self-centered"", ""it's not all about you"", ""wow, you're so proud of yourself"", etc etc (jokingly, for the most part), and I think all of this ties back to Fi vs. Fe."
ENTP,Furthermore I have the absolute best arguments with political types.
ENFP,"Or is this just a question of ""You're spending way more time with X than with me, you should spend some of that time with me""? Because I respond well to ""I feel like I haven't seen you enough lately. Let's try to hang out more."" But really badly to people complaining that they're not getting as much time or preferential treatment out of me as another specific person. That's gonna come off as a bit petty and controlling to me, and it's likely going to make me more uncomfortable hanging out with them, and possibly even make me kind of want to avoid them. I think the problem is that being jealous of one person who, in this scenario, is clearly one of my closest friends, is just not going to endear someone to me. I've also experienced this situation as the person who someone was jealous of (that is, I was spending more time with our mutual friend than she was), and it was obnoxious and tiring. It's not my responsibility to put you first or be closest to you out of all my friends all of the time, unless we are dating. "

I have direct experience from your point of view because one of my long time best friends is an INFJ, he was also my roommate. When we INtP's debate, or question something (which is all the time. If we aren't verbalizing it, we're doing it constantly in our heads, which is why we're quiet and observe all the time.), we are just looking for a truth, a better understanding of the world than we have had previously. We have a neutral stance until the facts say otherwise with no emotional involvement. We are not judging you as a person, it is not a personal attack, and are not trying to be right. When said a person will question ""why are you a hot mess"", we're wondering why you're getting emotionally involved, because we aren't. Why are you taking it personally? We aren't judging your worthiness. "

She does not drink, smoke, cuss or anything else.  One of the sweetest people in the world (extreme introvert) but, her vice is gambling lol Who knew.  My dad bought her a slot machine to put in his shop for her birthday.  She was pissed.  He thought he was doing something sweet.  ""It is not winning my own money that is fun"".  Send it back and well, she ended up with a new SUV instead   Which, is what she wanted.  My mom going to Vegas or Biloxi or any casino still boggles my mind.     You and I had a crazy similar upbringing even half-way around the world in a completely different culture. This goes to show how incredibly ahead of his time Jung was. "
INTJ,"Originally Posted by sysha   From your responses it seems like journals are a no no for INTJs . I find that odd though, the INTJs I know seem like the kind that would like  leaving an everlasting mark of their awesome by recording their feats and predictions, perhaps to use as a guide when parenting their kids later on (being the ultimate planner) ""And this son, is how I dealt with things at your age.."".    I used to put out family newsletters with a lot of photos in them and humorous stories of our adventures.  I'll probably start doing that again sometime when I am living somewhere where I'm happy to be, but that was about as far as I ever got with a journal after teenage years.  I am more inclined to set down thoughts in letters with friends or ""follow up on my thoughts with actions and research"" rather than set them down just to read them again."
ENFP,But mostly my friends call me a hipster because I dress strangely. I have odd interests.

INFJ,"Originally Posted by InsanityRemix   I figured somebody might possibly like a thread where they will be able to post the random things on their mind, whether it's an idea, a simple thought, complex thoughts, problems... Anything they wish to share without criticism or judgement. Let's face it, writing down our thoughts, feelings, wisdom, etc., isn't the best thing to do because, although often personal, it disallows the communication with other humans we so desire (plus this saves the trees that we should be using to cut down on carbon dioxide, yet we instead cut them down)."

ISFP,"So in this particular case, I realized today that Walmart sells combat boots from the 'Faded Glory' brand for roughly $20 and that made me smile, as I live in combat boots pretty much all year round. I have a pair I really don't care about that I wear for my job in a grocery store and they're pretty sturdy (they were more like $70.) But unfortunately I've scuffed those up something fierce. When I want to look a little more presentable -- like when I'm going to a more upscale than usual show or trying to turn on my FWB when we're out with the group in prep for a romp -- I figure I can pair the lower quality Walmart ones with a cute (and sometimes revealing..I'll call it cute-vealing) outfit. Even though they're lower quality, they're really pretty.    I'm surprised sometimes at the shoes I find at Walmart. I found a pair of boots I call my ""jingle boots"", black biker-looking things with a low cut and these fake metal bangles on them that make a lovely metallic rustling sound when I walk, kind of like spurs. They're not really tall in the leg, but not short enough to be confused with regular shoes. I love them for dressing up and their heel is low so my feet don't get sore and I can walk without rolling my ankle."

When we have conversations it often ends with her nagging or probing me. It's so annoying! What do you ENFPs think would be the best way dealing with this?"
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Artemis 2x4   Just did. Choose another way or term to describe our conversations/interactions next time.    I wasn't talking about our interaction, I was talking about the interaction between ESTJ (Delta) and ENFJ (Beta) and why that interaction might not work."

ISFP,"On the other hand, if you can ask him out it will make his decision a lot easier on a lot of fronts. That indecision that DLila, and the whole thread about the ""infatuation game"", talked about is deeply frustrating, especially since we've got cultural expectations saying we should be decisive. If you're willing to buck convention and just do the asking, especially if you're gentle about it, it will probably make him feel taken care of and much more sure that the results of this decision are going to be positive. I honestly couldn't imagine anything more comforting about the insecurity regarding starting a relationship then the girl I was interested in asking me out. "
ENFJ,I guess all I want is someone to be honest with me for once

Obviously this is just a stereotype. I'm not sure I know an ENTP in my life, if I do they're keeping quiet about it.    A lot of ENTPs don't realize they're actually ENTPs until later in life. Why do you perceive us off the chart?"
ISFP,Then they talked about the Wall Street and prices on there.
ISFJ,"This is an unhealthy ISFJ behavior of being too scared to be honest.  She probably feels like if she's honest to your face, that you'll say something back to hurt her.  But probably due to Si habits, she's also not comfortable with the fact of letting you out of her life completely.  It's also possible that she may have some loneliness and doesn't want to risk losing someone else in her life. "
INFP,"Honestly, this makes me so incredibly sad. I can't stop crying."
INFP,"I figured out my crush's real name (it was hard, because her name wasn't in the syllabus and my ear isn't trained to hear Indian names) and found her in the school directory. It has her phone number and everything.  Now I'm definitely not in danger of ever just never being able to contact her and never seeing her again, but I am in danger of seeming creepy, obsessive, and stalkerish. So, it would be better if I got her to just give me her contact information and invite me to friend her on Facebook and stuff."

Did something like that just a week ago. I still haven't received any answer, but it's cool, at least I can move on. I suggest you do the same, if they don't change their attitude after that, my guess is they probably don't care enough and are not worth it."

ISTP,"Especially when you spent the night at a ""friend's"" house and totally forgot about it even being the first day back; scrambled to get dressed and find your under garments that were flung about the room; hustled back to your house to pick up a notebook in the cold and rain that turned into snow, then freezing rain and back to rain again, which ruined your hair; were in such a hurry that you didn't get to shower or eat or drink anything, so you're hungry and dehydrated and you're exhausted from a lack of sleep, a 6 hr dance practice followed by getting it in the night before; had dudes try to talk to you while waiting for the el but weren't in the mood because you're pissed, miserable and a hot mess and you forgot where the building is that your class is in because it's been so long since you've had class on main campus. The dirty looks from the fashion majors who live on campus aren't needed. Sorry, I don't carry my entire makeup bag and straightener in my pocketbook, I know I look a hot mess"
ENTJ,"We just have very high standards. It takes sifting through literally hundreds of girls to find one that it'll happen with. We're not the type to pick the prettiest person in a group of 20 people and think we're going to spend our life with them, that person may become a friend. We pick the best all around person we find in the literaly hundreds of people we cross paths with within a week and then investigate further, and even then about 3/4 people fail."
ENFJ,The fact that I grew up more nomadic than the other kids in my family meant that I was mostly alone and lost in my own world. I've never really had an opportunity to explore any relationships with my mother's or father's side of the family like others did which meant that I don't really know anyone and no one really knows me. 
ENFP,"It's just my guess, though.  What have you guys observed/experienced?    Yeppers.  I think really, though, that men in general are biologically less disposed to display emotion, I think cultural expectations takes cues from that.  "

My reasons (since that housemate was a huge jerk as well)? 1. This girl wouldn't try to take control of a situation in the house that she had put zero effort in. 2. A majority of the conversations I had with her were intelligent, 3. She didn't talk about herself all the time."

It can come suddenly in the midlle of a sentence, and leave just the same as I sober up.    This, very much. I'm a social drunk. I'll talk and talk and talk and share feelings and talk about myself and offer unsolicited advice and tell people how much I appreciate them. XD People like me better drunk, too."

Don't even know if there was any music on. My graduation on the other hand was one of the most important days of my life, but I still can't tell you anything specific about it. Nothing ""sensual"". Just basic information, but nothing SI-specific. It's pretty weird actually. Probably makes me seem like I'm dumb or something (I'm not, I swear). The way I remember things is more...I don't know.

INTJ,"Originally Posted by Abraxas   There's this general stereotype of INTJs being really obsessed with efficiency, having an urge to devote themselves to their intellectualism with a kind of rigor that other types lack, which stems from their 'J-ness'. They hate incompleteness or 'dabbling' in things, and like ENTJs, value mastery of their interests - although, unlike ENTJs, they're not so concerned with the approval of their peers as much as meeting their own high-standards. I'm just wondering if that really applies, or if it's just made up based on various personal interpretations of the cognitive functions. I.E. I'm looking for some evidence from the 'horse's mouth' to validate some of what I've been reading lately around the web, since so much of it sounds like speculation based on what the writer has read in a book.

I love art, and have good sense for what is good art, but honestly, I stink at color, and also have no fashion sense, but I know what I like, and am very much adherent to that--and refuse to wear things I don't think I would look good in, or rather that I don't feel comfortable in.

INTP,"Do other INTPs experience what I call ""words falling between the keys"" when typing on a keyboard, meaning that when you've completed a sentence you realize when reading it that one or several words are missing to make it understandable and complete? What causes this phenomenon? Is it just that my mind is so much faster than my ability to type? Sometimes I also find myself typing completely wrong words because I'm already thinking of something else than what I'm supposed to type. That seems to be more of a ""normal"" thing though."
ESTP,"But most of it means basically nothing or isn't actually all that important. More like spur of the moment, ""I wonder if there are spiders on the Starship Enterprise"" type things.    The answer is no, as there's nothing for them to eat"
ISTJ,"My mentor came back to town last night (she moved to SC).  She'd stopped at the derby shop in Bloomington and bought some new wheels on her way up here.  This means that I now have wheels to practice in the hangar (although I'll need to get bearings for them, but the bearings are only like $20 - i.e., she is going to snail mail me her old wheels).  I already have wheels on my skates, but those wheels are rink-only wheels.  She also made noise about being my sponsor when she gets paid in two weeks.  Another girl on the team can't skate right now because she's due to have a baby in January; she offered to lend me her (small) wrist guards until then.  This means that I'll only need my butt pad (getting as soon as I get my mileage reimbursement check), elbow pads, helmet, and mouth guard."
ENFJ,"...also, I'm very fond of elipses, I just noticed that =P"
ENTJ,"2. Not my motherland of Indonesia, that's for sure. Any other first world country where I wouldn't need to learn another language."
INTJ,Blood types deal with the types of antigens on your blood cells.  This comes into play during blood transfusions and pregnancies.  
ISTP,"I had a totally awesome truly random thought earlier in the kitchen, but I was watching netflix and didn't want to swipe to the safari app to type it. My laziness is amazing."
INFJ,More food & alcohol tonight.  This time with moms.  Ready to take a nap again.  
ESFJ,"Now, back to the topic... I certainly don't see many ESFJs on the internet, or at least any pronounced ones. The ones that ARE probably just aren't browsing PerC or other related sites. Just speculation though."
INFP,Tired of waiting for life to get better.  Tired of trying to make my life better.  Tired of being an INFP.
INFJ,"Venus in Aries, Mars in Pisces, Pisces Moon, Taurus Sun...a heady, complicated combination, but tonight...it makes me feel cool."
ESTJ,They work hard but they work stupid. They do stupid work. 
INTP,A friend of mine with terrible arachnophobia chose the moccasins.
INFP,"You should rant here on PerC, perhaps we could empathize with you (: (actually i know we could, everyone on here has no doubt proved that haha)"
ENFP,I'm an ENFP but I'm asking a question to my fellow ENFPs ~
ESTJ,"Imagine if I went to the INFP forum and said: ""As far as I heard, you're all sociophobes who lock themselves up in their room. Also, you self-harm and create your own fantasy world in your imagination. Please prove me wrong, otherwise, I won't believe you!"""
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Snoot   I don't think I could pick a favourite. There are so many to choose from. Why, why would you do such a thing to me?! Now I will obsess over it for days and days. THANKS!"
ISFP,"I just want to be content with being in the moment and not worry about much else past that.    I understand. I am different in the way that I don't care as much about the past, but still struggle with being in the present, as my mind is more often than not wondering about the future. Probably because of my Ni."
ENFJ,"People give me such great energy, but they also cause me so much pain.  I'm so tired of being used, despite being fully capable and exercising my ability to stand up for myself."
INFP,"Annoyed fangirl is annoyed.    LOL!  People who draw massive conclusions from tiny samples annoy me more than almost anything...  Thou hast my sympathies, my brother is the king of that.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd guess that it's a 'J' trait?"
INFJ,Your last two posts make me think you need to drag him out for a date.
INTJ,".    Yes, me too. His mother carries strong Fe and he's so Fi and it just explains the annoyance I have with Fe in a comical way, it's brilliant."
ESFJ,"mom: OMG THIS STUPID LAPTOP IS BROKEN AGAIN! CAN YOU FIX THIS [my name here]?! ARGH IM SICK OF THIS SHIT! (repeatedly bangs on the keyboard, thinking it would fix it)"
ISTP,It's also hysterical because my INTJ knows that I just don't give a fuck about what his folks think of me. I'm just polite to them for the sake of common courtesy.

ESTJ,"Is possible that these ESTJ's you are having problems with simply dont know they're acting this way? Especially if they are family wouldn't you like a good relationship with them? We are extroverts, aka not good at listening, we're not always good at noticing when we do something that may seem offensive or controlling, and no we're not really that gushy. But I will tell you that we are complete suckers for those in pain, especially if it is because of something we said or did. It simply crushes us. All I can say is, I am way more of a softer person because my mom and sister (ENFP and INFP) both had the guts to tell me that what i was doing was hurtful to them. I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. "

ESTJ,"1. What kind of traditions do you like to follow (if any)? I know us SJ's are stereotyped as being conservative and traditional, but I feel for me It's more of what I grew up with than what society considered traditional. is it the same for you? Do you have family traditions?"
ENTP,"It's quite different from the extroversion of an ENTJ or an ENFP for instance.    It's hard to compare with ENTJ's and ENFP's. I get along with both well enough at times, but often time I find ENFP's lacking motivation and direction and ENTJ's lacking character."

When, even after the conversation goes well, you reanalyze everything that you/they said over and over again because you're sure you did something wrong.

I want to have someone to get to know and cherish. Do I have to work at it, does it just happen? I don't know, but it won't happen when I'm in this state of mind. So i'll have to really discipline myself to keep my eyes, mind, and heart open. It's the hardest thing.."

INTP,"When I don't have any work to do, I get bored and want something to do."
ESTJ,The ESTJs I know don't blindly follow orders -- they're more likely to challenge authority or do contrary to what is ordered.  Usually because they want to be the boss themselves.  
ESTJ,There no communication now; she hasn't replied to the last three or four polite platitudes and there's probably nothing I can do.

INTJ,Is this a possible scenario?    What a ridiculous notion. Logic can't be obsolete. If it was then nothing would be true and I'd become a Nihilist.
ENTJ,They are able to face problem with less stress than the other and expect higher productivity in all subjects of their life.

And then a couple of hours before the work is due, you get super charged and end up finishing everything on time, or you just give up when you know that there's no way to possibly finish. Then you get mad at yourself for being such an epic procrastinator and vow to never do it again."
INTJ,"As far as the 8/8/8 hours, I usually get 6/7 hours of sleep a night. I work from 8-5 (actually more like 8:34 to 6:12), then it's family time until the kids go to bed at 9 and I spend the rest of the time with my wife. At work is about 10-20% work and 80-90% surfing the internet, reading and posting on here (lately), playing computer games, and listening to music. Any time I stay at work after 5 is because I get overtime for it and I'm not ready to go home yet where I'll have responsibilities and people wanting my attention.      Originally Posted by antiant   When you are meeting someone for the first time, say on a date, or getting to know someone, it's like auto-pilot, the questions start around the framework of the Protestant work ethic, ""So, what do you do for a living?

It's like, ""Wow, how does what I do for a living say anything about who I am as a person? Don't you have anything else to talk about rather than your job?    What you do for a living could very well indicate something about who you are as a person. A lot of who you are is by the choices you make and what you choose to do and continue to do for a living is certainly a choice you made. And from that one can get if you like it or not. It's just a topic. The topic isn't important, it's the person's ideas, thoughts, feelings, and reactions to the topic that tell you about the person. Maybe they want to make sure you're not someone who defines yourself by your job and they want to see how you answer it. Of course this isn't always the case and may not even be the case the majority of the time, but it's not always not the case.      Originally Posted by antiant  What the fuck do they mean, what's my type? Don't they realize that you cannot accurately describe or define your type and that it doesn't work that way? People are not lists you can check off or a piece of clay you can mold.    But regardless of how futile of a goal it might be to accurately describe or define your type, how you respond to such a question can tell about you. It can tell if you're someone who has put much time or thought into your type. How much you long for someone else. How adept you are at putting your thoughts and feelings into words. Maybe even a barely-coherent description of your type is enough for them to get the idea. They may not even be comparing themselves to your type. Maybe they just want to know more about you and they can get information by what you like in others. Not everyone would do it for this reason, but some might. With the latter, the initial question would probably be just a starting point for the discussion with the hopes of taking it way off topic based on each others' opinions, ideas, and reactions. Do the questions you ask or hope they ask of you have a different hope?      Originally Posted by antiant  Also, as far as my type is concerned, let the chemistry happen or let it flow, why should I stifle and restrict my opportunities by trying to put my type into a box?    From how I see it, focusing on the initial question and taking them at face-value is just as stifling and restricting the opportunities of the conversation and the rest of the date. Letting the chemistry happen would be going along with the questions, viewing them as merely topic-starters who's content only matters long enough for you to say something relevant to, and seeing where it takes you.      Originally Posted by antiant  I've noticed in my own experience, that once you describe or define the box, the other person will try to fit that. You think they are on the same page as you, but they are not, they just talk a good game, they become ""Yes men."" It's kind of like, ""I like to draw, I like to travel, look at my pictures of my recent travels."" ""Wow, that's really cool, I like to travel too."" Yet, they haven't shown any proof that they do this, they start to mimic you and this mimicking makes you think, ""Oh wow, you're on the same page as me!"" When in all actuality they are not, their just an imposter trying to impress for the benefit of themselves.    But on the other hand, some people are honest. You tell them you like to draw and travel and they say they can't draw but wish they could. Then they want to see more of your drawings. They've never traveled but maybe always wanted to. And they start getting ideas of maybe traveling with you so they can experience it, too. It's true that a lot of people are trying to impress and agree so you'll like them, but 100 bad apples doesn't mean there are 101."

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Sunset in paradise   This isn't going to sound very logical to you at all and I don't intend to be right now, I was definitely not talking about INTPs regarding that debate I had with a thinking type. One of my closest friend is an INTP and we actually get eachother very well, because we make up for the T and F difference intuitively :) So please don't think I was referring to INTPs. I was spefically describing one argument I had with another type, and trust me I was frustrated because we just could not see where eachother was coming from what so ever. There was zero common ground. See, you back up everything you say here with facts and so on, but they just straight out called me a hot mess and made many many ILLOGICAL assumptions with an arrogant attitude and contradicting themselves. Well it's how I saw the debate anyway, if you want to check that out its in my quotes section on a thread about ESTPs :L "

Digital video board games can be fun to me, too."

Let me try to help you discover a new perspective! - In David Keirsey's please understand me II, he explains where he believes temperaments naturally build self esteem (Guardians - Beneficent) (Rationals - Autonomous). Now if you will Marlowe, introspect, how you would feel if someone tried to make you less Beneficent. Beneficent means ""Generous, or doing good"". Now put yourself in the shoes of a Rational, and someone trying to make you less Autonomous. Perhaps this is a new perspective to consider."
ENTJ,You want to play like you're bad yet you get easily offended. You want to seem tough yet you're soft and take the preferences of others personally. Just because you dislike something doesn't mean everyone else must carry the same sentiment.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Clyme   Actually, I do have another question for you both. "
ISFJ,"Unfortunately, romance only works if both people want each other. It doesn't sound like she's interested in the way you're making advances toward her. I don't know how you show your ""soft, romantic"" side, or how many different ways you've tried showing it, but I would suggest stopping whatever your doing for now. The advances and passionate looks are pressuring and stressing her (hence the intimidated look). She's cool already, and pressure and stress coming from you will kill any hot feelings she may have for you. She already knows you want her, and for her to feel the same passion you have (if it's possible), she has to want you. Which is part of why it hurts, right? Because she's rejecting that part of you (and that probably stresses her out too, because she knows she's not living up to your expectations). In order for her to want you, though, you have to be a source of stress relief, not the source of stress.      Originally Posted by INFP_BEE   Our love life has been pretty much non-existent for a long time and I've been trying to reignite a spark, but she always tells me that she doesn't really want us to date or be all lovey-dovey with each other. We are basically friends and I swear that's the ideal situation for her. She just seems like she prefers our marriage to be somewhat of a practical situation only. It's like we are one big family where there are 2 older siblings in charge (me and my wife) and two younger siblings that we care for (our kids). I don't doubt that she loves me, I just feel like she probably just loves me like a brother. Oddly enough, that seems to be not only alright with her, but actually preferred.    Then you shouldn't date and be lovey-dovey. That stuff is meant for her to feel special, but if it doesn't make her feel special (or even has the opposite effect), then there's really no reason to do it.      Originally Posted by INFP_BEE   I ask her how I can help get the spark going again and she just tells me to help her out more around the house. Thing is, I've always prided myself in being a very devoted husband in regards to doing my fair share. I always strive to keep our level of effort on the day to day duties as even as possible. I just thought that maybe her love language was acts of service, but when she did a test on that, acts of service scored in the middle. Companionship was first, which makes sense since she seems to really cherish the friend aspect of our relationship. Don't get me wrong either, I cherish it too, but I pictured more in my marriage and it's wearing thin.    I think you're confusing love and passion. Love is about caring for someone, doing things for them, sacrificing for them, etc... passion is an emotional thing, it's about desire, release, imagination, letting go of the normal world and going somewhere else. Doing things for her might help her get to the point of showing passion for you because she doesn't have to worry as much about housework (which is probably what she's hinting at). So in that sense it can be a spark, but she has to desire you already if things are going to get hot."
ENFJ,"An Entj came into the Enfj forum asking how to demonstrate empathy.  Well this is the cursed side of it, people know you are empathetic and they use and abuse you because of it."

I am cool, but I get tired when people are being fucking morons and ego centric, manipulative, drama whore bitches. Do people forget that I have feelings? Just because I seem oh so compassionate, wise, insightful whatever you call it, it doesn't mean I want to stepped over like a carpet with your fucking subtle insults and energies. You think I don't feel them? You think you're the only one with a destructive dark side? Think again, fucking morons. Do you think I'm that stupid? Do you think I cannot see through people and cut through their motives, and then later manipulate them in a way that becomes totally out of character for me? I bet you never expect that, do you? I don't know why people assume that a feeling creature is like a carpet. No I do not want your dirty shit stained feet stuck in my past stepping over me, because I am too good to be rolled over by uneducated, low class bitches. I smile, I give off some light, but you know what underneath that smile, I have thought about, from time to time, the people I want to punch so badly. I want to punch those people and bury their asses so deep in the sand they wouldn't know what hit them. I am not your carpet, not your ego boost, I do not take kindly to being taken advantage of. If you want war, you'll get one, just wait for it. Stupid mother fucking brainwashers still running loose with their filth, with their shits that you can smell over a few miles.

INFP,Originally Posted by murderegina   I''ve speculated this. What makes one bad? Lack of truth of themselves? The truth can destroy every falsehood decorated in a hollow ignorant bliss and in doing so this can breed sadness. But the things that truth can destroy is always worth it. Look further into the mechanisms with the truths that you hold and see your sadness. Inside every sad thought is a hope to be found. Hope brought to life is what the pursuit of happiness is about. It is a calculation to made and staying inside sadness isn't finishing what you've started.    a lack of moral and/or the wrong morals. throw in a self-assured attitude that dosen't percieve anything one does as bad.

I wanted us to be able to try something further, but I know in my heart it wouldn't have lasted anyway.  And my heart would have been even more hurt than it was.

So rather than saying that I judge the worth of people, I'd say I judge their worth to me, and what they can contribute with to me and to the society. If they don't do what they're assigned on time, that would decrease this. If they hinder the progression of things by being plain stupid, things like that. But still, it doesn't decrease their actual worth or value, just how I view them. "

ISFJ,"Again, really sorry if this sounds like an attack, I don't mean it that way, just really want to understand this particular sort of behavior. I miss my friend and I want them back, but I don't want to feel like im the only one putting any effort into our relationship.    Something very, very similar happened to me. I'm very confused because I'm not even sure what I actually did that made them act like they hate me... I've tried asking but they've been very vague and clam up...They haven't verbally said anything like ""I hate you."" But it's quiet evident in the other things they say.

I think Intps are generally quite J-ish in a way, because even if they often are surrounded by chaos (like their apartment) in their mind things are so much more clear. Thats my impression anyway.

I've actually known a couple of these women to claim to have used said vibrator while sitting at their desk at work, so masturbating while at work is not necessarily outside of the realm of possibilities.  Of course it can be a bit more difficult for the guys as a separate office, bathroom, or other secluded space may be necessary to the task at hand (pun totally intended).

ISTP,"Originally Posted by Japhle   Got my first example of someone mentioning a glare from me today. I got T-boned( while coming down a road about a block away from arriving to work. This girl(probably 17 or so) plowed through a stopsign straight into my rear right wheel, hit my car so that it spun in a 180 to a stop. bent the wheel she hit back into the wheel arch, probably damage to the suspension, maybe the frame, possibly the exhaust, etc. I'm expecting it to not be reasonable to fix. When I was talking to her after I was just trying to figure out what I need to do to make sure I have all the info I needed. Insurance, name, license plate. I probably should have taken a picture of her driver's license too and her face at the scene as well, and I forgot to turn on my hazards too since it was in the middle of the road.   While we were waiting for the police to show up though she was talking to her father on the phone and it sounded like she was uncomfortable with the way I was looking at her I guess. Kind of silly to think about considering she locked her brakes at the stop sign. Is it that unusual to feel contempt for someone that's just wrecked your whole year? Enough contempt to glare at someone? what the hell am I even saying,    I was struck in the rear bumper late last year, the damage was relatively minor, bumper skin was torn off. I was at a complete stop waiting for the traffic in front of me to move, then this woman exits out of a driveway and clips me hard, pushes the entire rear end of my car over. Sure, she has insurance and all that, but it seriously pissed me off, my adrenaline was pumping hard, I could think straight, couldn't barely hold a pen steady enough to even write down her information etc. I spouted a few choice words at her in the process. I took the insurance money and plan on doing the repairs myself. I wonder how my painting will look when it is finished, since I've never used an HVLP sprayer to apply two part automotive paint.

All I do is give my friends a few pointers on how to write. I might at most send them a little cheat sheet outlining how they ought to go about structuring their response. What they do with and how they use the information I provide subsequently, is not under my control and is not my responsibility. And of course I do not charge a single cent for my services; as a thorough audit of my finances will reveal, the only person from whom I have received money from is my father. All I have ever done is to assist my friends, within the constraints of the law, in their hour of need; as they assist me in my hour of need. These accusations of academic misconduct are without any basis, and I daresay, may have been fabricated by rival students jealous of my obvious academic prowess. I have a sterling record as a student, as all of my professors and tutors to date will testify to, and there is no precedent which suggests that I should get involved in such illicit activities. The prosecution, further, has no witnesses nor evidence to show, no example of an instance in which I exchanged an academic work for money; only hearsay. Your Honour, I move that this case should be dismissed on the grounds of a mistrial, and that I am acquitted with my name cleared with the same publicity and fanfare with which it has been besmirched."

ESTJ,How could I help him see the other perspective and see the relativity of things without that he feels that I'm not taking him serious (as this would make him angry).
ESFP,Well I'm not sure if that ramble answers your questions or not but keep in mind that if you're in doubt with an ESFP...shower them with love and affection. LOL    Yeah I dream about relaxing alone with a book while my significant other goes off on their own. I may try to surprise them every once in a while if it's an activity that's really important to them. Like dancing I suck but I'll risk looking like a fool if it makes her happy lol.
ISFJ,I have been told I will be a great parent a few times.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by antiant   Very interesting, still trying to find some information to 'test' my hunch here, so bear with me, I'll be leading you down the 'rabbit hole.' Have you read this article yet? Got this idea about Ni. What do you think? I'm curious how well you can relate to this article. If you can relate to this, in which ways do you relate? Are there certain concepts that stick out to you in particular or not?    Absolutely. Basically the whole article, but I'll condense it to a few main points:"
ISFP,"If I could use it to my benefit, I would, but it hasn't done me much good. I've caused unnecessary conflicts with lab partners, professors, friends/family, ect. If this honestly what being an ENTJ feels like, then it's reliving to hear that it's not my personality type. But I feel like I'm overgeneralising here as well."
ENFJ,Originally Posted by reckless summer nights   Screw you. ;) *The presence of my ex-boyfriend still reposes here.* Not kidding by the way.    You want to screw me???? I'm not sure we know each other well enough for that. ;)
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Laguna   I see you have your enneagram listed. Wonder if that makes a difference in this.    Hm, maybe! There's slight changes in how the motives in my enneagrams change, but it's still there. "
ISTJ,Getting out of socialising and into the books sounds like an excellent plan! There's nothing more stress-relieving than cleaning and studying when it's becoming a burden and you haven't had time for it.
INTP,"Then when I wake up, I'll have to wait till night until I can get this mind set again."
INTJ,I apologize if this has already been asked (not overly interested in skimming 66 pages :P):
ISFP,And thankyou for your input and advice! I never think about improving myself so I can feel good enough about myself to be desired or wanted by someone. 
ENFJ,"One girl in my friendship group always gets overlooked. She always has been. Today in form I told that she should be appreciated more and explained why and she almost cried. She said it was okay that she doesn't get noticed and that she didn't mind, and I told her that that wasn't fair and it needn't be that way. "
ESTJ,I found it impractical when there are a lot of girls actually pursue guys and succeeded.
INFP,I can't stand it when people blow me off. I'm literally freaking about in my room right now because one of my friends flaked out on me today. It was twelve hours ago and I just keep getting more angry about it. It's not like giving me a call and telling me you can't or don't want to hang out is hard. I can understand certain situations but not calling me back or trying to get a hold of me just seems really low. I don't feel valued as a person at all when people do that. That's all I want is to feel good about myself but it's getting increasingly hard lately. Just because I'm not outgoing doesn't mean I don't want attention. It just means I think the attention should be deserved and not actively searched for. Why do I have to be such a baby about stuff all the time?
INTP,The cat is using the tub as a litter box. Which leaves me having to clean it every single stinking day.
INFP,"I held hands today with my crush. <3 It was great until other people started walking by, including an actual couple, and she got self-conscious and dropped my hand.  When she was talking, I was so so close to kissing her that I could already taste her lips. But I thought it would be rude to interrupt her, even for a kiss."
INTP,"Originally Posted by Ablysmal   I've never considered age as an indicator of knowledge or maturity. I don't understand how age can restrict people from knowing things. Alright, there is a difference between the minds of a 5 year old and 30 year old, but I'm sort of referring to late teens and adults."
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Starbuckskat   If you have a crush, are you all day dreamy about them, or do you prefer not to do that?    Both. I prefer to do things to distract my attention because I am not going to tell, anyway, and I don't always think about it if I have nothing to do, either. "
INFP,"anyway, yeah i definitely feel that way, i've noticed that as i've learnt different foreign languages, it's like i can see the world in a whole new way! it's like looking through differently distorted binoculars or something... and that's part of what i love about foreign languages. just as they say, so much can be lost in translation, and sometimes there's really no translation at all. i hadn't thought about it terms of communicating emotion, but i can totally see that, seems true to me. i've heard english really sucks as a language, lol. i'm just glad i didn't have to learn it as a second language, would be a really crappy language to have to learn i think!! though of course english has it's beauty too.

Fair, In my opinion what makes life hard is finding what makes your insides fill up with warmth. It's incredibly hard, and some people take the easy route of slamming the round peg in the square hole just to survive. "
INTJ,I've only ever had one. Good times.    I have four of them if I want it.  Don't want.  There is a time before coitus and after coitus where you either have to be drunk or hungover to be able to bear the conversation.

I don't have time for this, geez, if you're still clingy and paranoid towards a boyfriend who took care of you for such a long time already, and you didn't want to listen to my advice, then stop.

ISTJ,"I'm just annoyed because the Bach suites are considered the greatest music ever written for cello and I haven't met many people my age who disagree. I do appreciate a lot of the work that Bach did, just not his cello music. While I'm ranting, I guess I'll add this. In high school, I bought all six Bach suites in one nice book. It had a few bowings already in there, but Bach never put in any bowings so that was the opinion of the guy who published that book. So my teacher just copied his own copy, and now I have to carry it around. I even asked him once, what was the point of me buying the book? He said that I could copy it into the book, but I realized that that's really confusing, crossing out bowings and putting in new ones, etc. I've noticed with my teacher that if I try to defend my musical choices by saying I saw someone else do it or that my high school teacher had told me that, he said that in college I had to make my own decisions. But I realized that what he really wants is for me to do his styles."

There may be some undiagnosed allergy triggers and stress related triggers as well, but it's difficult to pin point if those things are consistent triggers or occasional ones.  Mostly cuz we can't find anything that I'm allergic to (besides dust) and I'm so good at internalizing stress, I'm usually not even aware that I'm stressed out.

Good luck.    This is of great help - Thank you! Blabbing is a big problem for me, so i will definately be using this advice! "
ENFP,"I noticed a thread about things that insult ENFPs(bear with me here, don't run away!) and noticed something that I recognized from my own friendship with an ENFP. I know he's very talented when it comes to reading people and with controlling emotional situations (he freely admits that he has this superpower) However when we get into discussions I do sometimes sense that he starts using that ability when he's frustrated with the way the conversation is going. Now my reaction is usually to confront it as soon as possible, just to be like hey dude cut it out and focus on the issue. Because he is very smart and I do enjoy reasoning back and forth but I hate feeling like he's trying to dig up my personal feelings and unbalance me. "
INTJ,"Second, what would be an example of you changing your mind about person if you felt burnt or betrayed. Can a person redeem themselves in your eyes ? if so how ? Would love to hear your answers.    Are you talking about an actual literal door, like when we're angry? I tend to be such a door slammer. I'll be furious and leave whatever situation has caused me to be so. Usually this involves a disagreement with another person. Then I'll go slam the door and leave. I'll come back when the person who I feel has done me wrong (or a representative of same) makes an effort to make peace with me. This could come in the way of a phone call, or visit to come and talk with me. A person can be redeemed in my eyes. Yes of course. First I always want to see some degree of genuine forgiveness from them. Really I want them to actually say the words ""I'm sorry..."" I am learning, however, that not everyone gives an apology in the same way. My wife comes from a culture in which an apology is offered more through expressed attitude then through spoken words. Hope that helps."

INFP,"I don't think I could find a way to live life for myself. I always thought to myself: ""If I could not dedicate myself someone, I will dedicate myself to my ideas and principles.""

It feels like crap. I know being around them and being surrounded by them isolates me, but perhaps it is all because I am not connected to them. Maybe if I found something that connects me to everyone, I wouldn't be like this. I want to remove the looking glass, let me go through, connect me to this world."

Or if they don't listen every time they make a racist remark make a racist remark about them. Maybe then they'll see how stupid it is.    If it was that easy. One vs many is not good.

ISFP,Originally Posted by Clyme   Thank you for offering me your perspective.
INFP,I have so many things that buzz around in my head I don;t know how to sort them all out.
ENFJ,"All in all, I think I can help them cut about $300 bucks worth of unnecessary spending [if they'd only listen to my financial advice more] which should allow them enough room to manoeuvre in case someone falls sick. I think it's pride on BIL's part more than anything else. He has too much of it - and we as a family have none. This guy's been living here for 8 odd years and he still hasn't learnt how to save money, or grow as an individual - which is the cause of my sister's pain. "
ISFP,"And I hate when I explained my principles or my thought to them I tend to create false impression to them (I do not know whether I made a false impression or not, I just fear that happened). It's like my thought are not easy to be explain to someone. When I feel about something, I knew about it, but to translate it into words, it's a different thing :|    That, what you described is Fi, and it is not something that translates well to words--certainly not easily, and no, it is not something we are comfortable with as Fi-doms. Part of the problem is, as you described, that you feel like you didn't explain yourself well, you are misunderstood, etc. Trying too hard can lead to situations where you end up blowing up or stressing out. Fe is the expressing feeling function, and in my experience, sadly, it seems that Fe types don't really necessarily know what they are feeling, or don't understand their feelings until they speak them. The insecurity we have _when_ we speak, they have when they _don't_ speak. Weird, eh? Fi feelings are best expressed by us via actions, and not words. Fi-Ne types--XNFPs--love to use words, but not directly. They prefer more metaphorical speech or more abstract communication--conceptual. We prefer action--maybe art, maybe service, maybe something else with our hands, but not so much with words. Words are the ISFP's enemy. ;-)"

You need people who can act like branches to hang on to get you out of that path, to give you a fresh perspective and help you move on a different, more fulfilling and happier path.  You may already know these people who can help you or you will meet them in the future, for me it was both ways, when I needed it.

I knew it bothered her which is fair enough I guess. When I see her I get the impression she doesn't really like me. But I have always kinda had that impression soon after I first met her. I'm just wondering if it is something specific. It's not a big deal I just find it a bit awkward because I don't feel as comfortable as I normally would going round my friend's house when invited. She's not overtly mean to me I just get the feeling she's not my biggest fan.
ESFJ,me: *opens internet and goes to the website she wanted to go* so what's broken on it?
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Sela   Although I've said it before, after reading the above posts, I am so grateful that I am finally done with school.    I'm kind of nervous about not being in school next year, I've never not been in school. I'm a bit excited though."
INTP,"Originally Posted by Fienigma   It makes me sad that even after knowing what I intended, you still chose to perceive it the wrong way. It makes me sadder that I can't change it. It makes me even sadderer (yes, that's a real word) realizing that everyone has been interpreting it that way."
INTJ,Is there a thread for INTJ videos? We've recently made one in the ISTJ forum...
ISFJ,"I think I stopped making sense a while ago, and like I said, I'm just kind of typing what's coming to my head here. So meh, take this for what it's worth. :"
ISFJ,You know you are an ISFJ when the first time you read the description of an ISFJ that you teared up a little.
INFJ,"Originally Posted by ClarityOfVision   I was thinking about the problem of overpopulation and how to solve it. I thought of imposing a child limit per family, but then all families are the same, and that is not the case. Some families work harder for this world than others, produce more, so then those families should be granted extra children, as they are more useful to the world then. But then who makes the selection and will people accept that system? Complicated "
ESFP,"I'm an INFP and my mom is an ESFP. She works as an imaging technician, so she sits next to a loud machine in a dark room all day and cant stand the constant WWWRRRRRHHHH noise. She told me she, ""wants to replace the bad noise with happy noise."" So I told her about the music threads on PerC and that piqued her interest because she hasn't really listened to music for many years (we like a LOT of the same stuff.)"

ENFP,"But I won't deny it, I've had my share of proposals and stalkers. But I really don't have much time for relationships outside of work, other than situations like PerC. I can take my iPad with me to work and post in between patients or during breaks, if I'm not with my colleagues and attendings."
ISFP,"2. I used to have anger issues that manifested as a lot of passive aggressiveness and occasional spouts of violent arguments. Then I was depressed for a while. I think I could probably get really addicted really easily if I tried an addictive substance and liked the experience. I'm not sure what else might be qualified as a ""dark side""..."
ISTJ,"The British were the colonial overlords of the Americans making them the authority. The Americans however considered themselves Englishmen with the rights they are entitled to. This includes representations in Parliment. Taxiation without representation may seem like a trival cause but when compared to the fact that the Americans were without representation in all issues except for the lower house of the colonial legislature this means that parlliment could treat the Americans like a conquered province if it so wished. The writs of assistance and high-admiralty courts were bad enough but it could have been worse. Practical martial law in Boston sealed the deal. We dumped the tea. We were punished for it. Simple enough and within the bounds of authority. However, the other colonies needed to have a say in whether or not Boston should be punished. It was at this point that Britian ceased to represent lawful authority because it did not do the job that as a government it should have done."
ENFJ,"Judging people, being obsessive, being a bully, knocking people over, doing lots of drugs and being completely disloyal to everyone around me as I engage in my hedonistic BS, fill my house with crap I like, be angry, stomp around, yell in traffic jams because I'm so much more important than everyone else on the road, expect everyone to do whatever I say---"
ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Ancient   My wife has a big problem understanding that other people have different points of view. Anything that's outside her scope of ""normal"" is deemed ""weird"" and thus not good.    Yeah it took me a long time to begin to see past my worldview and acknowledge that there are other worldviews besides mine. Also, to see that other points of view are not weird primarily because they disagree with mine. I think that is how my husband's personality type has helped balance mine. And on the other hand, he says my personality type has helped him understand that emotions are a neccesary part of cognition. (he advises not to call your wife an imature esfj. ( : )"
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by tnredhead   <...wishes her BFE town had Indian food.    My town didn't, until recently.

They're both ALWAYS very crowded during the noon lunch hour, though.  The food is great, despite the exterior appearance of both buildings."
ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Cathrine   You weren't offensive. To seem like an ESFJ is not a negative thing, thereby pointing it out to someone isn't offensive. I posted the scores to you, an INTP, because I thought it was funny that I actually got an INTP result while probably being ESFJ. :)    The scores are indeed interesting. I wonder I mine were esfj ish I forget."
INTP,"It's kind of funny, but annoying at the same time. Or something."
INFP,I have no time to myself and no control over when I have to be where.

ENTJ,"And does anyone else ever get a strong hit to the feels from time to time when it involves the suffering of others? For instance, I had an incredibly hard time watching 12 Years a Slave, and it seemed like it was more so than anyone else with whom I was watching the movie. I didn't cry or anything (I'm not really a crier), but I actually felt sick to my stomach throughout the majority of the movie."

ESFJ,Another thought: they might know how terrible their coffee is and might not have the courage to admit it.
ISTP,Finally back from the skiing trip. It was so much fun. I want to go back :(
ESTP,"As for your last line. The way I evaluate ""good"" and ""bad"" is in rather a goal and consequences oriented way. It seemed like you had a different approach and I wanted to know more about it."
ENFJ,"Just because a group of  people, a nation, or country think something is right, doesnt make it  so. Just remember not too long ago it was ok to own black people and  beat women. "
ISFP,"Fellow ISFPs, do you fangirl a lot like I do? What do you fangirl over?    Very often but become disinterested very quickly. It's kind of like at the moment I'm super into it and want to know everything about it and absorb the entire essence of it, but as soon as the moment passes, I shuffle on over to the next thing. :P (or sometimes it was the other thing that lead me away from the previous thing bahaha)"
ESTP,The first one is You know you are an American when.

ESTJ,"For the last sentence, is there a point here? I just, to me thats just stating the obvious so I am confused. And no, I dont use this to allow myself to be open to everyone; in fact i am not an open person at all. I like my space, being by myself and learning learning learning. I do not share things unless to learn and certainly not personal stuff. In fact, I am not open because people keep making quick annoying judgments merely for my giving an opinion on a subject; so i only share with few people. Only time I will be outgoing is when there is something I want to learn; and nothing gets in my way of that. I study the functions more so to respect others and learn about them accordingly, as I am not aware of much around me but my own self most of the time; super self aware person. So i utilize Ne to explore/learn. :3 Hence my giving a suggestion of, should we get some INFJs here or not? Why? Oh ok. Why did I suggest it? Oh this is why^^^^. and then i get a ,Oh well your wrong because you are being stereotypical and so and so. O.o ummmm Yes....thats nice............so should we have some INFJs here or what? O.o"

ESTJ,They use the brute force method of getting through life.
ESTP,Originally Posted by Sensational   Well I will make an exception if I cant find matching ones. But I prefer matching. I actually like new socks and probably buy more new socks then I should. I like them really white and fitted elastic.    I need to buy more socks. My usual sock shopping habit is buying large quantities of socks at once. I haven't bought any since September 2014. It is time for more. The whole reason I asked the question is because I was in a hurry for work and couldn't find a matching pair. I said fuck it and grabbed a matching (style) pair of black socks with a mismatching stripe (color) on each. I was bothered by my choice.

INTJ,"You silly child.     Interesting how you never explained how science could tell you what your purpose is. Let me ask you, how does science explain the whole abortion debate? how does science tell us to make moral decisions? Does science see beauty?"

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ferroequinologist   And.... reading back over this. I don't know that I helped you any... I think that the biggest thing is having a project--a need--something that drives you to accomplish the task. That has always been when I did my best at learning, and coding has been no exception. In my case, I needed a web presence, and needed to do it myself (this started back in the late 90s, believe it or not!)

The measurement would be gone... but it makes me wonder how the human condition would change from it....    LOL! You are completely intuitive! While thinking about the subject, none of the questions you asked even crossed my mind :)"
ESFP,I do not forget my mess and I know it is there. But my attitude is I'm not bothered and I don't care. My want to do something depends on my mood.
ESTP,"it makes me laugh and does motivate me to actually get out and ""DO SOMETHIN'!!!"" as he'd put it. ESTP's can be great motivators."
ISFJ,When someone gives you a suggestion about something you've already made up your mind about and you can tell that their suggestion won't work as well for you as your original plan but you don't outright shoot them down because you want to make them feel like they've been helpful because *you* like to be helpful so much.

I am at one point in the universe but that point is undefined and Te says - hey i am at all points and i will precisely define every point. of course it is very abstract the distinction, but nevertheless a valid one. thanks "

There are many reasons why you might get distracted, forget about it, whatever. I  do that too.

ENFJ,"And I understand that you're in love, and I truly think that's wonderful, but surely you have had almost three years now to find the balance between time along with your boyfriend and ignoring the rest of the group when you're boyfriend? If I'm alone with the two of you, there is basically no point in me trying to start a conversation because you are all over each other. I think that your boyfriend anticipates the awkwardness and does manage to have conversations with other people. But the fact that you are so dependant on his attention and constant contact ruins the conversations you could have with others."
ISFJ,"You know you're a ISFJ if you think too much about what other people are going to think of your post before you post it, therefore you rewrite it 50 times before you do."
ISFP,I wish I had more goals in my life. Maybe I'd accomplish more.
ENFJ,"I came on the internet to try to sort myself out.  I am sick of being misinterpreted and ending up conflicting with people when my personality is always to care and help.  I take it way too personally when people don't like me, which at present seems like everyone.  We are moving to a little country town soon and I'm changing my name for a fresh start, but terrified that if I don't figure out where I'm going wrong I'll just end up in the same state there.

ENTJ,Probably the best place to start would be to do a little bit of reading up on body language. There are plenty of good books out there that can teach you the basics but a couple things to remember.
ISTP,"Either use it to blend in or help fuel your disdain when you see them in the flesh, the choice is yours ;) but don't let the horde of hipsters stop you from going where you want to do what you want... Unless you happen to be a very lucky bastard and you have an abnormally higher normal people to hipster ratio, in which case that would hardly be an issue and finding people in your class who you'll like enough to maintain some form of not-shallow comradery with will be much easier :) it took me until this year, being my second. Why asides from them being non-hipsters is another story."
ISTJ,"I'm sorry, but I don't see how that follows. If most of these women are not going to stay long because of an indefinite, unpaid maternity leave, wouldn't that waste resources spent on training them? Wouldn't that make male employees more desirable long-term?"
INTJ,"Yes, some sort of shuttle that the average person with the right amount of cash can experience."
ENTJ,"Now I'm super-picky about who I become romantically involved in but in a different way; the goals are different.  While I don't rule marriage out in the future if the right person comes along, I don't particularly feel a need to seek it, either.  The goal is enjoying the company only.  I find I'm attracted to someone who is witty, funny, doesn't need my validation all the time, isn't trying to change me to feed that validation, is intellectually active, can handle a woman who is ambitious and always plotting something or another, and is able to sustain a relationship. It's more about my personal desires now than the desire for the goal itself.  If I find that, I'll see where it goes.  Will I find that?  Let's say my hopes aren't real high, so I've taken the ""if it happens it happens, if it doesn't then it doesn't"" approach."
INTJ,"@antiant  Hopefully this is clearer, thank you for letting me know :o)     I indulge in silliness almost once a day. But I have not forsaken my logic, it's just become more abstract and ""loose"". Whatever goofy shit I come up with still makes perfect sense to me :)"
INTP,I was left feeling like I could create shit with my brain.
INTP,"Originally Posted by Marimeli   Rotfl, once I crashed Pandora by asking it to create for me a station with the parameters ""Iron Maiden"" and ""Beethoven."" it spit out a Yanni song and crashed. :) and you'd think with eclectic and diverse musical tastes, you'd be able to talk music with anyone, but it appears that the inverse is true...    Yeah. Spotify can't handle all the obscurity or perhaps I would consider it worth paying to switch to Spotify instead of Winamp."
ISFP,"I just spent a year abroad as a foreign exchange student. There are people I know and people I could call if I visited their country, but I didn't get emotionally attached to anyone as a close friend and find myself still stuck with merely small talk in the conversations I have with most of the people who were my classmates. It's like I wasn't even here at all. And I KNOW that it didn't have to be like that. If I put in more effort to meet with people and get to know them, I would have made some really good friends.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by monemi   I don't know if this is true of all ESTP but disappointing my parents growing up was a big deal. I wasn't scared of getting hurt. I wasn't scared of punishments. Or time out. Or being sent to my room. When I grew old enough to understand the concept of disappointment, it rocked me to the core when I disappointed my parents. I preferred to be socially admired and accepted. But it wasn't a big deal if people didn't like me. I could shrug that off too. Fe tertiary essentially meant that while I was socially aware, it wasn't very important that I was socially acceptable. That meant it was extremely hard to shame or guilt trip me and it still is. Think Madonna, right? If shame or guilt worked on us, we'd be very different people. But disappointing someone I look up to is devastating to me. It's a huge fear. Not to say you can't ever be disappointed in your child. Just, I had an adult (not my parents) use that too many times on me. They figured out that the only time I got choked up and cried was when she expressed disappointment. I gave up trying to make her proud of me and stopped caring what she though. In fact, I did the opposite of what she wanted because I wanted to hurt her as much as she hurt me. I'd be careful about using a weak spot too often. "

I'm usually a prompt responder, but I didn't know how to handle it, didn't know if I was mad or not, was analyzing the situation between us to figure out WHAT had set her off -- and I totally freaked her out.

What really drove it home is when she told me that it's impossible for men to understand the extent of sexism cause we've never been girls.

INFP,I have a feeling after I write this on another thread   
ENFJ,"I've found myself stalking this site for quite a while (not this forum, but the site itself), trying to get up the nerve to post something. I read the description of an ENFJ, and it kind of sounds too good to be true. Like, ""Damn, this person sounds awesome! That can't possibly be me."" Haha, is it common for ENFJ's to have low self-esteem? I have found that in my own home, and among my close friends, I'm ridiculously outgoing, loud, obnoxious. I can be blunt, selfish, insecure. But when meeting new people, or in a public setting, I'm much more reserved. I don't like to draw attention to myself in an unfamiliar setting, I prefer to sit back and observe until I feel comfortable. I don't like to call myself ""a giver""; I feel like a lot of the time, when people broadcast good things about themselves it's to cover up their own insecurities, such as, ""I hate drama"", ""I'm an open book"", ""I'm a great girlfriend"". I've found that, when you meet someone, if a statement like that is one of the first things they tell you about themselves, you'd better anticipate the opposite, if that makes any sense? But I guess there's a fine line between overwhelming insecurities and a healthy dose of confidence. However, that being said, I do know there isn't anything in this world I wouldn't do for the people I care about. Honestly, I'd still probably do almost anything for someone I don't give two-shits about, if they needed it. I read some things ENFJ's said about their personalities, like that everybody knows them, they have ""a cult following on facebook"", people quote them; none of this rings true for me. Some things I do know: I want everyone to love me, all the time. If you're having a rough night, I'll be up until 4am talking you through it, even if I have to be up at 6am. Growing up, I was frequently told to ""use your inside voice"". Losing friends makes my heart feel heavy, literally. My fulfillment comes from helping other people. I can be very selfish, and I hate to admit that. I HATE being alone, most of the time. I have a lot of energy, and am very patient. Am I alone on this?"

I would NOT want to be with a guy who didn't want to be with me....especially if the main reason was my weight.    Look, she was the one who let herself go.  She knows that I'm willing to stick it out with her while she loses weight.  And I truly am, but like I said, my patience is wearing thin.  "

I've often imagined Lenore Thomson/Jung etc finding out about this forum and completely flipping out, due to the crap that is spewed on here. You cannot help that, but you can help your own understanding by doing your own research and looking into things and finding knowledgeable people who do not have such biases and exchange dialogue, whether it's openly or privately. It's all a matter of balance when you look at the complete picture.

ENTJ,If you change your actions because not fullfilling peoples expectations will make them emotional so yes you are still changing your behaviour to fullfill expectations. It doesn't matter why you are doing it. I am NF too so I would say that you are making quite big simplifications here.   For example Fe and Fi works very differently and we are all also individuals. My long-term plan is to keep people near me happy and safe - not just soften their lives and keep them comfortable. If something has to be said I will open my mouth even if people doesn't like to hear me. But yes I keep doing things I don't like just to keep the peace and make things easier - I fullfill expectations if I find that it help my purpose. Sure I has my own goal but it doesn't change reality.

Nobody else can _make_ us do anything we don't actually want to. Nobody can really make you angry, or resentful.

I do fear the worst when I can't get onto someone and I don't know where they are. like if they said they'll be 2 hours and going somewhere by car, if it's 6 hours later I get worried quickly"

INTP,"Levels of sociosexuality vary between heterosexual and homosexual individuals (Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, & Gladue, 1994). Among heterosexual individuals, less restricted women (i.e., individuals who are more open to short-term relationships) prefer masculine male bodies (Provost, Kormos, Kosakoski, & Quinsey, 2006) and faces (Waynforth, Delwadia, & Camm, 2005) more than do more restricted individuals (i.e., individualswho are less open to short-term relationships), but these findings do not necessarily extend to female preferences for male facial masculinity. To our knowledge, no previous studies have tested for possible relationships between sociosexuality and male preferences for feminine women. Nor have any studies tested for possible relationships between sociosexuality and preferences for sexual dimorphism among homosexual individuals. Men with increased masculinity and women with increased femininity tend to report less restricted sexual behavior than those with decreased sexual dimorphism (Boothroyd et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2005)."

After reading this, provided you're sure of your type (and I'm sure you are), I don't need to question. "
ENTJ,"Since I don't know how you experience feelings, I can't really answer that question. We tend to feel things very strongly at times and then be neutral most of the rest of the time.

Money speaks louder than justice. People are so concerned with keeping their position of power that they're not doing what their office dictates. They ignore what's right in favor of what will keep the people happy, what will keep them in power. When will people finally realize that doing what's right, doing what you were voted into office to do, is more important than your reputation. When will people realize that we need to listen to the people without money, the ones who can't speak with power and authority. But no, they don't matter, they don't have the power to get you re-elected back into office where you can ignore more problems. "

They just tend not to opt to do anything interesting (going to malls, certain restaurants, the movies, other non-engaging places) and I'm not close to a lot of them, so I'd rather not go that say something and deal with raging asshurt, blatant passive-aggressive behavior, whining, or both. The activities are always so passive and ""safe"" (bland). With some of them as a smaller group I'd be more inclined to going without complaint (which is pretty much always eating), but otherwise with some of my friends individually or in some small group combinations I will voice my boredom and sometimes there's a good equillibrium.

I've been much more involved in nature, doing art, and just enjoying the simple pleasures again.     Yeah, FB, here, and that's pretty much it. I'm on one discussion list, but that's it. Oh, and that closure.... yeah... But honestly, I hate to lose this small group here. You guys have meant a lot to me, even though we are soooo different in life circumstances, there is a commonality here, of folks who understand me. That's tough to let go. Hence my thoughts of just putting it aside until the holidays are over--still reading the emails I get from PerC, and responding to PMs, etc. but trying to tone down my own participation... I need to ponder all I've learned, and see where I am going forward, and how to go forward. I have to confess, this past year or so has turned my world upside down. Between discovering personality types/temperaments, and a couple other things about myself, it's been a bit like Neo waking up, and discovering that everything he thought was real--wasn't.

ENFJ,"To explain. We dated over the summer and I thought things were great. He was a gentlemen, my parents loved him, everything was great. I went on vacation for about a week and when I got back and I saw him again he broke me. Now, I wasn't mad at him for that. I was upset, but I was okay with it since I believed that he broke up with me because he didn't feel the same way anymore. I couldn't help but wonder why he broke up with me, he never gave me an explanation  So the next day I asked him why he broke up with me. What did he say? He said he broke up with me because I was too fat. I admit, when we dated, I was chubbier than I am now. But at that point of time, my need of approval from other people was a lot bigger than it is now and it left me completely heartbroken."

First is that Windows updates are stuck at checking for updates and nothing happens. This happened to me on Windows 7 before too. So I'm not going to bash Vista here too much. I downloaded manual update installer and since support is ended, I won't ever need to care about them. Second thing was that Opera installation didn't start. It only started when I enabled Administrator mode in privileges, because normal Administrator mode didn't work. Also I noticed some hangs in OS, but I think, it's because of my slow HDD. Anyway there's nothing too bad with Vista."

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by ImpassionedHeart   This is adorable. It's so funny, because my girlfriend is an ENFJ and initiates subtle displays of affection (sitting close, her foot touching mine, resting her head on my shoulder) much like you. It's her way of closing the gap between us when we can't be as open and intimate as we want to be. I'm more reserved when it comes to PDA, and tend to return it reluctantly (making sure people aren't watching first), but if she stopped this, I'd lose a sense of emotional security and long for the closeness. I didn't realize how much I actually adored this about her until reading this post. :) In her own subtle way, she draws me out of my shell and lets me know I'm safe and the world isn't as harsh as I fear it to be.

But why return is what really boggles me.    He's inflexible in general. He seemed to have a set vision of what he wanted our relationship to look like. I think he envisioned bringing me into his pre-established relationship with her (platonic friends, she's like a sister) and for us to be one big happy family. He tried to force that scenario. I wanted none of it. I don't like having my life planned like that. That's why I don't want to commit to him now. I don't want to feel pressured to conform to his plans/ideals/vision. "

I see feelings as the immediate response to a situation that I have evaluated. It's like there's a direct connection between my head and my heart.

ENFJ,Just a question though... how do you hide how you are feeling?  I have been told by family and friends that I am like an open book when it comes to what my feelings are.  Apparently they see it on my face long before I say anything.  Though I can still fool those who don't know me well I think because they don't know what to look for.

INFP,"I legit have a frenemy. Initially, I was a little attracted to her, but she totally ruined that with her bullshit, and now I'm not sure what the hell is my benefit in being her friend, letting her talk my ear off all the time.

ENTJ,Personally I'm rather indifferent it's not a turn off if a girl wants them but i do find myself more at home with a girl who isn't so family focused. 
INTJ,Example conversation (emotions present from person throughout):
ENFP,How do ENFPs feel/think toward INTPs? I have specific things in mind but figured a broader question would yield more answers that could be discussed and narrowed down later. I would like to say though that I have more dating relationships in mind for the question but knowing the whole spectrum of relationships would be interesting to read.
ENFJ,"Life is never going to be what I want it to be, therefore I'm trying to change what I want it to be ... but the pieces I want don't seem to be fitting together completely just yet.

Do I go looking for it? Or do I ignore it? What do I do when neither answer seems to matter anymore. "
ENFJ,"Discrimination of the same kind I see on many of the forums is the same discrimination that has caused so many devastating atrocities in real life over the years.

ISTP,"It's funny, my ESTJ friend prefers women who act like girls over women who act like women. "
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Southern Kross   From reading a bit here about ENTJs, I've noticed that loyalty and commitment come up a lot. It's clear that you guys take relationships seriously and will fight hard to help, protect, and stay connected to the people you care about. At the same time, there seems to be an impatience with and disdain for the faults, weaknesses and failings in others. There's also an eagerness to cut your losses and bail when people become too burdensome. The contradiction is interesting to me and I'd like to understand how it works."

My ideal careers are either professorship in literature, or a senior design engineer like ohtochooseaname. Two completely different fields of education. Should I flip a coin on this? Or maybe I should just quit school and do what I want. But if I switch into English, I'll have to write a bunch of essays. :( I don't know if I want to do that. And I don't know if I can stand doing math and physics for 4 more years. Hm.. School is a pain. :(    My professor teaches philosophy and theology. He's a monk. Well, a friar. His name starts with ""Brother"". His primary ""job"" is to be a good monk, be on time for chapel, get along with his brothers, etc. He's lived an interesting life. He's been around the world and understands many, many different cultures, and it's fascinating to hear him compare and contrast them. He's learned a lot through observation and experience. His secondary job is to teach. Both philosophy and theology have a certain logic or science to them which certainly appeals to me and probably to him as well, if he is an ISTP. I don't know if I know any ISTPs in literature, but I just don't know many ISTPs in real life."

There was likely something already wrong, building up. I seriously want to know what that ISFJ's self-respect level is. I want to know what's going on that has caused this ISFJ in their own mind to blow things out of proportion, and scapegoat as if the world is ending. I think that ISFJ needs a hefty dose of other people's perspective of the history between you, and soon. I don't mean people who agree with the ISFJ, I mean people the ISFJ can trust who also aren't biased. A big problem is when an ISFJ says, ""You're taking this other person's side! Why can't you just understand where I'm coming from!"" conveniently dodging the fact that they aren't seeing things from your perspective, and likely won't begin to until after getting some sympathy."

Of course it's advantageous.

ESTP,"I attract NFs too. I commented on it in the ISTJ forum back when I still thought I was ISTJ. I had wanted to meet SJs and was scratching my head over why I was having trouble meeting them IRL since they're so plentiful. Instead I kept meeting NFs, especially in the romantic context."

INTJ,"Is he expecting you to be sorry for anything? The way you wrote it it sounded like this need to be sorry just came from you, and I don't know why it does. Again, I don't understand why you are looking for something to be sorry for. Is it that important to blame yourself for this? Is the only indicator of blame him saying it was 'mostly' his problem? If so, does the rest of it have to be you, or could it not be other external stressors?    True, he isn't all that friendly around others; he has mentioned before that these friendships are really shallow, something like a way to get through the school years without people labeling him as 'emo', which is a term wrongly used (as he said before), but with the same intent anyhow."
INTP,"That reminds me of 'Zombieland', so I will amuse myself today by trying to compare things to it. Yesterday was 'Shaun of the Dead', because the preacher at the church here was doing a sermon on marriage, using clips from the movie 'When Harry Met Sally'. That topic, surprisingly, is pretty boring for someone like me, so I started trying to compare things in the same way as he did with my favorite romantic comedy."

INFP,"As an INFP I naturally value what is True (as I can see it), and not all man made distractions like ego-satisfaction and ambition. "
ISFP,"Part two. our extroverted function is sensing. Sensing is a non-verbal function, but tends to be rather active physically. My littlest child is an Se dom (or aux, hard to say at her age), and rather than ask for something, she'd rather grab it, or crawl over you to get to it. She just ""does"" rather than speak. It's been a challenge to get her to ask and talk about things before doing. ISFPs are very similar in that way. We would rather do than say. So, between the absence of words, and the physical expressions, you may see a full range of responses. The key here, is not to look for anything in particular, but a _change_ in behavior from the norm. "

I find I can start new habits quickly,  but after several months or longer,  I begin to feel like it is a ball and chain about my leg,  dragging me down,  and it slowly gets harder and harder to maintain. In the end I find I have to mix it up somehow. I love/hate routine. Without it,  I accomplish nothing. With it,  I don't want to."
ENTJ,"As I said earlier there are aspects of being an 8 that I don't like about myself. Being quick to anger, coming across as aggressive and forceful, being contrary, leaning into conflict, having people dislike or resent me for dominating them. I don't want to be the biggest barrier to my own achievements, and I get better outcomes if I mitigate these aspects of my personality when it is appropriate. "

I've cried over patients I've had before but never in front of anyone. When my jimmies do get rustled for whatever reason I'm always able to decipher why pretty quickly. It's rare that I'll have to sit down and go ""good god WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM"". Ne definitely helps supply potential reasoning for why I feel a certain way."

I'm extremely confused about life, but I think this will pass. Things usually turn out for the better, or I get lucky, or sometimes things just get blown over. Kinda stressed, I don't think that helps anything. I just hope I can find some way to cope or to ground myself, I mean, writing used to do that for me, but now I cant write as much.

I think if you start to be proactive and split each issue up so that they're not all overwhelming you, you might be able to find a way out of all this.  "
INTP,"Dunno what led me down this train of thought. I figure that if bugs were bigger, people would be much more willing to eat them.

INTJ,"Our willingness (lack of it to be precise) to assign any value or interest to emotional situations.    Before Skritter McGrumpypants puts any words in my mouth let me explain what I meant.  Admittedly, I was terse to the point of being vague.  As far as a weakness, INTJs often (usually, really) have a huge blind-spot where emotional context and events are concerned.  For us, it is often simply due to emotional content being extraneous or superfluous and, thusly, we put very little if any time into developing understanding or competency in emotional...well...emotional anything.  Unless you have tasks before you that are specifically emotional in nature (counseling, therapy, etc) emotions are pretty much irrelevant in any sort of efficient thought process.      Originally Posted by Sanskrit   Forgiveness is an act of naivety...    It will come as shock to nobody but I'm going to disagree here.  Forgiveness certainly can be a naive thing to dole out and, often, is doled out based on emotional criteria (thusly, by and large irrationally) but I'm a firm believer that forgiveness isn't given because someone deserves it.  It's given because they need it to continue functioning at whatever level they are personally capable of.  It's a logical concept consummated by empathy that most INTJs will probably turn their noses up at but if someone is hurting and my forgiveness can ease or completely abate that hurt I think it could be (case dependent) tantamount to cruelty to withhold it simply for the sake of some sort of internal grading system.  I am not so cold as all of that."
INTJ,"[QUOTE]       Originally Posted by aphelion   I would argue with that. What about the abuse victim whose partner keeps apologizing?

Just because the victim is doing the right thing, and being forgiving doesn't mean that everyone else is going to respond in a way that's morally appropriate. And 'forgiveness' in this case might not necessarily mean staying in the relationship. They could re-define the relationship to one where the victim is no longer in harms way. ie split up until the perpetrator mends their ways.   "

We have an almost identical sense of humour but the time difference is pretty much consistent.  I was wondering if this is to do with our personality types in some way - have other INTJs experienced this?  Other than that I can't really think what to attribute it to, but if anyone has any other suggestions I'd love to hear them as this has been bugging me for a while and I really want to know why!

ISFJ,"It is not an uncommon tendency for the ISFJ to support their ideas and values by using only the value judgements they make about the world and other peoples behaviour. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ISFJ personality is too self-centred to be happy or successful. Since the ISFJ's dominant function is Introverted Sensing, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If the ISFJ uses Extraverted Feeling only to serve the purposes of Introverted Sensing, then the ISFJ is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the ISFJ does not sufficiently recognise and sympathise with the way feelings effect the behaviour of others in the world to have a good sense of why things happen as they do. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat judgemental and full of fixed and often rather ambiguously polarised ideas about the world. Other people are often surprised by the vehemence of their ideas and are usually unable to understand how they came by them. "
ISFJ,"Thanks.    I wouldn't find a small gift weird at all, unless it could potentially have a bigger meaning e.g a male giving a female jewellery.  Something like a plant is harmless and sweet.  Being nostalgic beings, we'd probably look at it on a bad day and be reminded that we helped someone at one point.  I think it's nicer than chocolates for example because it's something we can look back on and not consume in one sitting :P.  Anything more is pretty inappropriate for this type of relationship IMO.  Even just a card with a small but genuine thank you would be more than enough for me.  The point is that it was genuine and well-meaning.

If I feel someone's very different from me, I will want to understand them and learn from them. And with getting older I simply admire their passion more.I do think that some FP males have a harder time just being themselves as they are constantly reminded by society that they don't live up to the masculin standards and should achieve more. This might render them more frustrated about life in general, but also see other men who succeed as people who accentuate their ""failures"" and raise the bar even higher.    Great points here, Riv. Thanks for the insight from the FP side, especially the bold part. It's hard to understand other people's way of thinking when the same things in life are obtainable given focus and hard work.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Echoe   I'm curious about how you understood Ni when you were learning about cog functions? Just wondering because I thought it might help confused people trying to type themselves. For example, I think I have tert Si and it took me a long time of periodic reading to really get Ni in general (I wondered if it was maybe my tertiary function instead). I just thought that if you ""used"" Ni you'd probably get it pretty fast, even while it's in lower order.    I like to think of my Ni as the secret sauce. It doesn't show itself overtly, but works, rather, behind the scenes, and pops out at unexpected times. It's not really very fast--at least, not in any obvious sense. Here's how I like to make it work for me. If I have a problem I can't solve--I may spend hours working on it--maybe a way of explaining something, or a mechanical or electrical problem I'm working on I can't solve--often it is when I'm trying to repair something that broke, and I don't have the proper parts, or the means to replace a broken part, and have to ""jerry-rig"" something. Or maybe it's a relationship issue, or whatnot... When I realize that I'm not getting anywhere, I then let myself sleep on it. I ponder over it in my head before going to sleep, and typically, when I wake up, I have the answer. Also, I often get inspiration while taking a shower in the morning. The ozone the shower creates puts extra oxygen in the air, and more into my lungs. I have mild asthma, so this helps me a lot. But here's the key, it only does its magic when I let it work in the background."

ENFJ,"I'm not really that complicated ... really. It's extremely simple to make me happy ... but I suppose it's just as simple to make me unhappy. I had gotten so used to the idea that I will never get what I want .. and I had resigned myself to a life of no expectations but then somehow I allowed myself to be convinced that I'm supposed to expect because after all everyone deserves to be loved.     But you should have expectations, everyone deserves to be loved. Hope is what keeps all of us going, hope for a better life, to find somebody to love, hope and setting new goals after we reached the last ones. You should take it one step at a time. Oh and in my case there is another thing, I like to make weird psychological experiments or analyse people in that way and try to poke them see if they react how I think they will.  I don't do that on purpose, it comes natural...like if I'm late (which is almost always) and the other person is a J, I'd start to tease a bit."

ISFJ,"My parents are an ISFJ and an ENTJ, and most sides say that it's ""duality"", then why is it that their relationship isn't so good? I dunno, it seems like the ISFJ always has to run around doing the actual work while the ENTJ dictates them what to do and the most efficient way of doing it. Can I get any help on how to make both sides bond better? Thanks so much! <3    Unfortunately you cannot fix your parent's relationship, or even advise them on what they should do (they would look at you funny anyway.)  What you do need to remember is that no one is perfect, no marriage is perfect and often parents do not see how their interaction with each other is affecting you.  So my suggestion to you would be to go to the parent you feel most comfortable opening up to and tell them how their actions are affecting you emotionally.  More than likely they will take it to heart and see what they can do to change.  Just know that ALL marriages go through ups and downs ... this is normal. :)"

ENFP,"I've meet at least two INFPs to who I was very close to. The guy I walked about was very emotional, but so was I when I meet him, and we pretty much learned to control his emotions together, I think that his wisdom made him aware that some people don't like too much useless emotion. I remember that he used to cry to very sad songs and I always thought that was an expression of his own inner sadness not a personality trait. Now that I think about it, it might have been both."
ESFP,"Originally Posted by Fat Bozo   ESFPs tend to be among the most forgiving people.  If you really are a friend to her, she's likely to let you be.  But it can't be more of the ""treated her like shit"" stuff.  Call her and ask to do something specific..I'd make a suggestion but i dunno what she's into.  But if she hasn't actually told you ""I don't wanna be your friend"" or ""Leave me alone"" then you've still got a chance of being friends.  Just ignoring or forgetting about one text message isn't the same as telling you off.  Basically, keep contacting her until she tells you not to.  But if she does, then respect that."

ESTJ,"My best friend is an ESTJ. We probably get along so well because of our mutual fascination with our respective differences in how we perceive things.

ESTJ,"Though, of course, I'm only stereotyping from my own experience. My INFP mother, aunt and best friend are quite the artists of passive agression when they need to be (like today apparently..... ffs.). My ESTJ grandfather, on the other hand, just tends to yell at things that anger him and tries to pull in connections with old friends to get someone he doesn't know fired.    All my statements are only based from my own experiences as well and unfortunately all the male ESTJs I have met are either abusive physically or emotionally.  Every ESTJ I know is extremely passive aggressive; way more than any ESTP, ESFP, INFP, ISFP, or INTP I know. So for example; if an ESTJ was to be abusive towards another individual it would most likely be behind closed door, while an ESTP wouldn't care as much who it's around. If an ESTJs values are threatened and an INFPs values are threatened, in my observations the INFP would less likely care about getting angry and yelling in front of a huge crowd of people than an ESTJ would. ESTJs are less straight forward when it comes to conflicts; they want to save face at whatever cost, so they wait until they're in the domineering position and cannot be threatened by outsiders to lash out on their victims. That's pretty passive aggressive in my opinion. Of course I do agree with your statement of ""Any individual with problems can be agressive, passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful, from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between."" I just stereotype ESTJs and ESTPs to be the most abusive.

ENTJ,"- How much incompetence and weakness in your loved ones about are you willing to forgive and/or overlook?I'm struggling with the wording of your question.   It's because I separate incompetence and weakness.   There is no shame in having a weakness.  Everyone has things they excel at and things they struggle with.  I see a partnership as learning to step up to compensate for the other person's weaknesses.  I've got your back. Incompetence, though, implies a sort of willful ignorance, or lack of motivation to change or ask for help - wallowing in it.  It's a choice.  Decide whether you are willing to at least make an attempt to grow or change, I'm moving forward - with or without you. "

ISFP,"Originally Posted by RK LK   A lot of stuff going on in that post...but yes to everything Passive aggressiveness is common in Fi-doms. We like to keep things peaceful but at the same time negative feelings will arise and we have a hard time suppressing them. My INFJ mom raised me to be more sensitive to others and to avoid conflicts also, but I think a majority of ISFPs are kind of naturally peaceful. It's difficult trying to understand what is truly right and wrong. It seems that there are always people who morally inferior than you, and people who are morally superior. I think judging things based on morality is instinctually ingrained in Fi users. Intellectually I'm pretty nihilistic and relativist, I don't believe that some universal moral standard exists other than in our imaginations. At the same time my actions are always based on principles of fairness or what I think is fair. Pretty much I still end up trying to do the right thing even though ultimately I don't think there is any purpose to it. It's kind of confusing!Laziness: CheckIt doesn't sound like you were being manipulative about the break up. It sounds like you were just reacting naturally. I think Fi users hate having to change people in such a direct Fe kind of way. We want people to search inside and find out who they truly are for themselves.    Thank you for the response and sorry for this one being late. You know, if I could I would like to not be passive aggressive or lazy. I've been going through a time lately where I feel like I've been a little weird, like maybe I'm ""trying too hard"" to be good? I don't know, the mode you have for yourself seems to be one sort of way to deal. Another thought is maybe I'm giving others too little credit in our interactions, as if I would know what's better for them than themselves? It's possibly kind of insulting, I think it's just a anxiety and wanting to ""feel"" good. I probably want people to coddle me and it's kind of embarrassing. I think when I have an anxious thought I give it more weight than it needs, and when I see people in the world act evil I feel like I'm evil and can't separate it? Which I think is self absorbed, and I'd rather not be that way."
ISFJ,"you know when your an isfj when your waiting to congradulate the groom at the wedding.... and the only interaction you end up having is noticing that he has an empty bottle in his hand so you walk over, and take the rubbish to the bin because you know they will not get the chance to walk over themselves, because so many people want to talk them as well."

It is my experience that I don't have the same interests as the majority.

I've thought that since I was a teenager, and before it was cool. But sometimes I will listen to pop-music ironically.

I cannot (disclaimer: I'm going to use an Fe term) ""connect"" with someone I don't respect intellectually.  Biologically speaking, I've noticed guys in general just ""go for it"" (interpret that anyway you want). So, what happens frequently to me, and over the course of many years, I have attention from ""oblivious"" guys that I can't even stand.  I've ended up with more marriage proposals than I can count from people that truly disgust me.  The disgust can be on many levels, from appearance and habits, to outright stupidity.

I was reading an advice column recently, not because I'm looking for help, but i'm interested in other people's problems, in an odd way. The writer of the column is a strong Fi user, so it got me to wondering how good a Ti dom would be at giving advice, especially an ISTP. Think about it, a combination of Ti analysis, Se practicality, and, if Ni and Fe were well-developed, an ISTP could be quite insightful about other people's problems. then again, most people would probably hate an ISTP advice-giver because ISTPs can be so blunt and often not tell you what you want to hear. But sometimes the truth is not about what you want to hear so much as what you need to hear.    If people want advice/opinion and are willing to listen, I can see an ISTP being desired as an adviser."

And on one occasion, a friend of a friend confided in me that she had gotten roofied and raped at a party. Bare in mind, we both knew each other well, but we never talked. In 6 years, we had maybe accumulated five minutes of conversation prior to that. And then I mentioned it off hand to the mutual friend (female as well), and she didn't know.

Apparently you do when you are in a bad mood, then you kind of act like an INFP, but from what I've seen that doesn't last very long.  Also, do you ever think about what you say before you open your mouth?  I would guess that of all the personality types ENFPs are the ones most likely to be labeled with an attention disorder.  Do you think that's true?    Basically, it has to do with people. There's a component that has to do with enjoyment of a particular set of company - more excitement, more talking (and possibly more volume). There's another component that has to do with wanting to avoid awkward silences. It's like verbal diarrhea. Novelty and energy tend to level out over time as a friendship is established - and age/maturity help too. But if I get really excited or if a situation is really tense, I will still babble. "

Don't give me hypotheticals, it will confuse me. INFPs are also expressive, but they tend to be drawn to things like poetry. Poetry is difficult for me, I enjoy reading it, but it often requires dealing in abstract and metaphor and I usually take it for face-value and don't dive into hidden meanings.

INFP,"While the English language offers a wide variety of word choices to facilitate accuracy, I agree with those who claim it lacks words that adequately describe some experiences within the complete emotional spectrum. Feelings aren't like flavors that can be described as various combinations of a limited range of possibilities like sweet, bitter, salty, sour, or savory. They are more complex than the ways we are affected by the physical senses. What I was feeling the other day had such subtle nuances that no combination of happy, sad, angry, etc. could quite define it or pinpoint its meaning. I struggled to come up with the right word, not because I lack self-awareness or adequate verbal skills, but because the word I needed did not exist. I eventually had to resort to comparisons with physical situations, to describe it symbolically by how it related to other things that were describable. This was especially limiting because it interrupted my train of thought and cut off the feeling I was trying to understand.Posted via Mobile Device(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"

Slow down when I can't breathe, catch my breath  and then sprint again. It's not really an exercise regime because I have  no idea how you're suppose to go for a run. This just makes me feel  better.    Oh wow, I like sprinting and running, but I sooo don't pay attention to those things you listed. Strange."

As I understand conspiracy theories, they simply counter the official versions of events and point to (other) people as the leading agents in the coming together of those events. Some use rational arguments and facts, others don't. So you can only call these theories as a whole irrational if you firmly believe that the official theories are always the only right and rational ones. Which is something very un-ENTP-ish to do.    I'd argue that what is rational is to not believe something unless there is something to back it. Since there is an infinite list of possibilities that COULD be true, believing something true until proven false would mean you'd believe an infinite number of things. I prefer: If there's enough to support said theory, I'd be inclined to look into it, but I find most theories consist of loosely held-together coincidences all nicely glued on posterboard and presented on a Youtube video with overlayed emotionally charged music to sink you in.

When she pushed him to do stuff he simply did not resist directly but in fact never did what was asked. he too has a great personality. the part about ""constantly bugging her to finish her chores or do her homework"" really resonates. I am not saying it won't work or that you shouldn't do it. However from a MBTI type perspective, you have to understand that ISFPs are extremely self critical of themselves and they tend to live in the moment. You also need to understand that Fi is directed inward towards the subject, not outward towards the object. Fi doesn't care about the external world or what it thinks. While I can't tell you that your daughter will be absolutely fine, you might have to learn to have a little more faith in her ability to find her own path in life. Extraverted types will observe how the whole works and tune themselves into it almost unconsciously. Thus they will, by nature of their type, seem to fit in with society. Yet, they have their own issues in that they never seem to discover themselves and are constantly at odds with their own subjective nature."

I had some laughing sessions with some people, by being childish...they made my all tingly and warm inside, it's a feeling I can't find words right now to describe. It's like feeling butterflies in your stomach, but in a good way, combined with the tingly thing."

Appalling.       Originally Posted by ferroequinologist   As to home schooling, well... That's where I'd be--oh, wait, that's where we've been. We homeschooled our first three children, and are about to remove our fourth from school at the end of the year, and homeschool her. Here's the thing about homeschooling that I just absolutely love. Oh, first, I studied education in college, and planned to become a teacher, so I'm not just coming out of the blue here... The classroom situation is not intended to make things easier for the child. Classroom methods/curriculum/etc. are designed to make teaching easier for the teacher. Think about that for a moment. It's all about helping the teacher, not the student. And by student, I mean your child. Sure, they want the students to learn as much as possible, and to try to narrow the differences (in results) among all the different learning styles, capacities for learning, etc. but at the end of the day, it's not about the child, it's about the teacher, or, to put it in other words, the group as a whole. The individual tends to vanish in such situations. There is an expectation, actually, of collateral damage. They will expect that some kids will be so far advanced that they will be bored, and there is a risk of them giving up, and losing their love of learning--so be it. There are also those kids who just can't learn, and who will fall behind--so be it. But there are also those kids who will be disruptive to the ""good"" of the whole, who must be neutralized--using whatever means necessary--whether it be the switch and dunce cap of earlier years, or the meds and ""diagnoses"" of modern times. If you can't break them, you shame them. It's ugly. Interestingly enough, back in the olden days of the one-room school house, all of these problems were much more minimized, as there tended to be fewer pupils, and the broad range of ages prevented such things as peer pressure from ruling in the classroom, as there were always enough older kids who looked down on the antics of the younger to prevent outbreaks from being positively reinforced by peer approval. Needless to say, there's a whole lot that could be written on this topic, and I say all that to say this:"

But how that plays out in real life, I really don't know. I will say this, the guy who cut me out thought, as near as I could tell, that I was being inconsistent, but the reality was that he couldn't see his own behavior, and thought in a hard black-and-white mode that didn't reflect reality. In other words, he misinterpreted my actions (or lack thereof) in the wrong way, but once he had that, he couldn't let go of that perspective. "

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by rebecaemy   actually some ISFJs have a well developed Ti, and are mistyped as some types who has a great development of ""T"" in general. You don't expect an analyst ISFJ, but some are like this, like me. That's why I was mistyped as an ISTP too, or an INFJ because of my Ne development.    After reading through this thread and the ""You know you are an F when"" thread, I am finding myself with a bit of existential angst because I strongly identify with the responses. I have always tested as an ISTJ but sometimes feel that ISFJ fits me better. Could it be that I just have a strong F function, or am I an ISFJ with a strong T?"

INFP,"I suspect it is much easier to learn the English language on a basic language than it is to learn how to understand the culture that goes with it - and how to communicate one's ideas in a way that makes sense to people within that culture. I think that is why people from other countries who are here speaking English as a second language can sound particularly childish, mentally ill, and so on. It's just that there's more to translate than just the words. The subtleties of language and culture are remarkably complex and rarely ever explicit; it's all implicit, and how can you know that sort of thing, if you are an outsider? Even watching English-speaking media would be too limited in what it could teach, since it displays a limited amount of accurate portrayal of our culture and the people within it."

Thinkers take the logical route and can sometimes ignore other's emotions because of it, whereas Feelers take the route that makes otherand themselves feel happier (or not so) even if it's not the most logical. In short (this might be generalizing): Thinkers tend to be more utilitarian and Feelers tend to be more friend-pleasers."

MLP tends to have longer story-archs and humour that's slightly cheeky and non-slapstick. More thought out with better character development.

There opinions though, are generally wrong and after studying the subject, the same people form a more informed opinion. But if you actually do study it, similar to any other subject like science, maths, logic, physics; you see why things happen, the reason behind it and its consequences. You see what is really going on. You see the whole picture, not the half picture and the subsequent opinion that the majority has formed due to lack of knowledge on the subject. It was in fact, the most common and likely common exam question for us. Discuss whether standards in language are declining and whether communication is improving or becoming worse. And trust me, that all the linguistic students, who understood the subject, chose the same position that communication was in fact improving not becoming worse, and standards were changing. "

I think it's pride on BIL's part more than anything else. He has too much of it - and we as a family have none. This guy's been living here for 8 odd years and he still hasn't learnt how to save money, or grow as an individual - which is the cause of my sister's pain.    My gay friend says that about straight men--egos. A recent discussion about gender roles has brought it to my attention that men get really douchey when they feel pressure to be strong all the time. They can't be tender in any sense of the word an that leads them to take it out on everyone else because they can't admit weakness. "

INFP,"Feelings are not rational. I don't really have an ""issue"". I'm rather offended you took that out of a casual conversation. Though my interpretation could be wrong. "
INFP,"I have so many things I want to do, but I'm afraid to do them because they might not live up to how they feel in my mind. I want to know why I'm here. I don't feel like I belong. I don't understand what everyone is doing, and why they're doing it. I almost feel like I have to hypnotize myself to an extent to continue on in this reality, and when I see other people I can only infer they themselves must have hypnotized themselves into believing what they are doing every day is for something. And it may be, but only to them. I want to know why I care so much about what everyone is thinking of me when I am driving my car. I have panic attacks from trying to guess what they're thinking, and I can't help but feel all their energies engulfing me as I drive along the road. Temporary chaos, until I get back to my room, which I have so convienently labeled ""the real world"" I like using the matrix analogy. To me anything outside of my room feels like the matrix. That's just me though. I wish I didn't have an age. I wish I could get taken aboard a space craft sometimes. I feel like I would feel more comfortable up there. Sometimes I feel like our minds were handed to us prematurely, and now I feel like I'm a chimpanzee fondeling a nuclear weapon. Sometimes I get so sad with intense emotion about who I am because I can't figure it out, and I get so frustrated that I don't see where I can go from there. Then I get upset with myself because I know better than to act like that. I wish I didn't have to talk to anyone. I've always thought words were frivolous, and never really understood small conversation, and social ""niceties"" I get a tightness in my solar plexus for no reason sometimes. Just sitting down in front of my computer, or in my car, or anywhere, for no reason whatsoever. I sometimes want to believe it's me picking up the vibes of others, but I can't be sure. If I could sleep for the rest of my life I probably would. Not because I'm depressed, but just because it feels more euphoric than being awake. I like to look at my eyes in the mirror. They remind me of tiny universes, and I feel a deep sense of calm, and security when I look at them. I feel very vulnerable writing this. I don't like sharing myself. I am very private in real life, and uncomfortable when people ask me questions about myself. I want to put all the galaxies into a box and relabel them as ""Divine Tic Tacs."" I'm having a panic attack thinking about posting this. I wish I could be someone else for a day. Or trade minds for a day. Or meld a quarter of your mind with 2 others and have a swirl of mind goo penetrating around the depths of our consciousness like a laundry mat on the super heavy duty cycle. I like this."

ENTJs are more Do'ers, and are more assertive with us (we don't like assertive people unless we agree with them), INTJs are more thinkers, and clash with us on a conceptual level (which I like at least), rather than the actual execution/task accomplishment level (not a fan), which is why there is the sentiment that we get along with INTJs better."

ENTJ,"More like, in casual association... you smell like clean linen. In a stinky cheese world. "
ESTP,"I use something (tool or whatever), put it down wherever, move onto something else and when I need that tool again, it's nowhere to be found. Generally speaking, my room's a mess, but I know where everything is.xD"

ENTP,"Originally Posted by Ka1serTheRoll   If you have sex with a prostitute without her permission is it rape or shoplifting?    Both. It's not shoplifting if you pay the prostitute, but it's still coercion which makes it rape."
INTJ,"Same for me, if somebody as done something they like and ask me to do it, I won't, it feels like my hand is forced."
ENFJ,"Had a python wrapped around me for a photo shoot before so,"
INTP,"Is it just me, or do Generation Y INTPs often (but not always) have an identifiably different way of expressing themselves in text?"
ESTP,"As for your other question, I don't know anyone IRL that's into typology so I don't think so. If anything I see people who are more ""acting"" a certain way on PerC."
ESFP,"1. I actually know myself to be somewhat of a drama queen, although at my older age I suppress it the best I can. "
ISFP,"Just when I start getting used to the time zone, America goes through daylight savings. It's 1:30 in the morning and I feel so active still, and my roommate has been asleep since 11... It's also supposed to snow tomorr- er, wait, it's snowing right now. You can't cut me a break, can you?"
ISFP,"Friend: ""Honestly, I just think shower gel works better than soap."""
ISTJ,"On an upside of me becoming less of a doormat, I had a good step forward tonight. My housemate and some of her friends started smoking weed in my kitchen which I thought was unacceptable. I was standing outside with one of our mutual friends who didn't want to smoke either and we ended up walking to Safeway. When we got back, my housemate apologized deeply, said that she forgot that I was in the house, and said that she wouldn't do it again. Instead of doing my usual ""oh no, it's ok"" I just said ""ok"" to acknowledge that I understood that she was genuine and that I wasn't angry. At the same time though, by not saying that the behavior was alright, I let everyone know that that circumstance should not happen again. "

ENTJ,Originally Posted by MsBossyPants   Had no idea we shared that in common.     I don't drink alcohol but the past few days have tempted me.
INTJ,"But If beauty is different for everyone, then how do you even know what I am talking about?"
ISFJ,"So, yea, any topic ideas for an ISFJ?    Personally, if someone I love is talking, that's all that matters. I love to listen to him talk about his day at work, things that upset him or made him glad. I want to feel involved in the things that I am not involved in. For instance, I've never met half the people there but I feel like I know them because he tells me about them all the time. I know I can't be with my friends all the time and that's okay, but when they tell me about things they did when I'm not around I feel almost like they wish I could have been there. That's a good feeling."
INTP,I am starting to wonder - is there on internet somewhere tool to simulate how would two random MBTI/Enneagram/both-at-the-same-time types behave each to other? For writing purposes (that's actually how I found out about typology theories after all). I am going to write detective story.
ENTP,Yesterday night I had a dream about eating a giant marshmallow. 
ENFP,"(Vague as hell I know, but I'm working a night shift right now haha.)     Never. I would feel too guilty. "
ISTJ,"Edit: Hmm most of the nasty ones were INFPs, they did take your post awful personal since you were only looking for insight into your mother's behavior and that you suspect she is an INFP. I don't consider that typism, even if you didn't convey it perfectly. For instance, I believe my mom is an unhealthy ESFJ - doesn't mean I assume all ESFJs act as she does, but advice on how to deal with someone who isn't in a healthy place is what you need, not namecalling :( (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"
INTJ,"I wonder why you are relaxed by the thing that makes everyone else feel uneasy.    Intimidating.. hrm. Sometimes I wonder if INTJs want to hear what I think, because it's most likely the opposite of what they conclude to. Also, when I think of how idealistic/illogical you will see it as, that also makes me giggle. Also, I don't see the opposite views being that we don't have the same intentions. "
ISTJ,"My own rant: Carelessly stepped on my earphone the other day, now the sound doesn't come out of the left side. I'm in mourning."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Jawz   Pretending to belong to a group apparently garners more respect apparently.    I don't get it...also, you retired...?"
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Lucyyy   Fine, this is really difficult for me to write."
ENTP,Originally Posted by devoid   Only in the sense that I enjoy killing people for no reason and lighting money on fire.
INTP,"I'd say it gets better as you age. I just developed outspokenness to ward off the tendency to do it. Like, why worry about whether he likes you when you could just ask? Asking is torturously uncomfortable but so is sitting in your room wondering why he suddenly went idle in the middle of your conversation without a word. Which is also probably why I was happy you asked him out...I imagine it's the beginning of the end of the torture phase :)    I didn't ask him. I decided that I would <.< (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"
ESTJ,5.) Paranoid - Only if something really matters to me and I want a positive outcome.
INFP,Why can't people see that all it takes for a peaceful world is understanding?
ENFP,"I'm on my way to work, driving...when, this itty bitty spider comes crawling over my gps. Whatever...it's tiny...no biggie. 30 miles down the rd...the cute lil' guy is climbing down the cord of the gps, towards me...as if to say ""Hi""..so... I killed him. "
ISTJ,"Then again, that would still be funny and interesting to hear about here regardless!"
ESFP,"I have been thinking lately: ""What is the point of expressing yourself at all? Especially if no one asked you to do it on any way verbally or non-verbally."" I think that the best person you can ask this question is an ESFP one. Also, even by asking this question I am expressing myself. That means that deep inside I still want to believe that there is some point in it. Otherwise, I wouldn't even think about it. However, I still can't find a point. Why would anyone want to know what I think, feel, want..."
ENFJ,"Where do I go from here? Do I take the next obvious step in trying to establish relationships with people who I've felt rejected by all my life [even though that might not really be the case] - which puts me in an awkward position of possibly facing future abandonment, or is this still a desire to regain a lost childhood instead of actually forging new bonds. Many of my current interactions are playing out in the same way - i.e. looking for fulfilling what I had lost 16 years ago."
INTJ,Have any of you ever changed your username (on PerC)? Or have you always been ____?
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by MsBossyPants   Right now, I'm sitting on the patio at Starbucks with my tablet, an internet connection,  an iced coffee and some food.  I'm good.  I could do that at home - I can entertain myself - but I like the option of people around me should I feel the need to chat or bounce something off someone.   I'll occasionally chat up a stranger who looks interesting. Have met some really interesting people that way.  Had some insightful and fascinating conversations.       Haha. Thanks."
ISTJ,"At the end I could publish it as something like: ""365 Days of X..."""
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by MBTI Enthusiast   But seriously, I think I may or may not know what you are talking about.  Hmm.    How diplomatic of you."
ENFP,"Okay good because I don't want some guy to feel the need to be my knight in shining armor all the time, if he wants to help me during like a crisis that's fine id rather be a dynamic duo tackling it together than a damsel in distress."
INTJ,"/rant.    I don't, I am extremely lazy when it come to work..."
ISFP,"@dmkinger  I've been racking my brains trying to think of something, anything, I could say to make you feel better about this. The thought of an ENFP in torment is pretty unbearably sad. I came up with an idea of something you might be able to do that might help. But I have to start by saying that, based on everything you said, I agree pretty much 100% with DLila: the best thing you can do right now is to review your relationship without the tinted lens you're seeing it through. Look at the facts of the scenario, minus what you wish to be true. It may be that you have to find a way to let go of her and move on."
ENTJ,I can't speak for every other ENTJ but we are about getting shit done. How it get's done doesn't matter.
ISFJ,"Might be interesting to meet an ISFJ, me thinks :)          Originally Posted by nicoloco90   interesting how ISFP and ENFP are first to answer so quickly though right  .... "
ENFJ,"She said she wasn't kind to get something out of it, but when I asked about wanting empathy and love in return she said that that would be nice. Which also gave me an inkling. "
ESTJ,"I didn't really have any problem in school, until I was about 11/12. Before that I enjoyed it, I was good at what we did, I learnt stuff (I've always wanted to learn interesting things, though I have a hard time putting down the energy and time if I don't enjoy it or find it useful, from when I was young 'til this day), and had lots of friends. After that though, we started having English as a ""real"" subject, (which didn't work out for me until maybe 14/15, where I went from lowest to among the highest grades), and I ""noticed"" that I didn't really have any friends. Well, I had friends to hang out with in school, but I guess that's where my Fi went in and said that that wasn't enough, and I wanted ""more"" than just that. So during the latter half of elementary school, I went through without having any real friends. "
ENFP,3.Dislike dealing with data. Yeah this make believe relationship is already off to a bad start because I dislike this too. I need my computer nerd.
ISFP,Originally Posted by Red Mange   the person crying and begging you to stay with them- is this a cat?    lol no.
ENTJ,Are you ever nervous? How do you behave then?    I'd never tell you that.
ENTJ,-waking up not wanting to start the day/ get out of bed?
ISFP,"Originally Posted by Ravenetta   I got back today from a month visiting my father in hospice who struggles to speak and is suffering, and then just now had a breakup talk with my boyfriend who lives with me. We have to figure out ""logistics"" :( It's beyond emotional comprehension for me. He is nice and I don't want to hurt him at all, but I can't do this any longer - it's like losing my feet. It's not an option for me. I also might be losing my mind to imaginative coping techniques.    I never know what to say when people are going through a very difficult time in their life. Clicking on the Thank button just doesn't do justice.  You have my sympathies. It sounds like a tough time."
INFP,"At the age of 15 I began smoking marijuana. At first it was mainly just social but eventually i started doing it a lot. I realize now that I was actually attempting to use drugs to change myself. I thought that if i smoked marijuana my personality would change and I would become like the cool, laid back people around me and I would overcome my problems. I began to truant a lot and I did absolutely no school work."
ISFJ,"But, I do see myself as traditional in the sense that I create my own sort of mini-traditions, that probably aren't often recognized as traditions by many others. Like eating a certain food while watching a TV show or something, and then I'll always associate that particular food with watching that TV show in the environment I first did that, and then I'll continue to do that because it's a connection to the past. At the same time I'm so focused on that type of tradition that I can create negative ones by accident, like if I remember a certain taste or smell from a really bad time, I'll avoid that smell/taste in the future because it'll remind me of that time. That's one of the main things that leads me to think Si and ISFJ over INFJ. "
ENFJ,"People love my stories. And I love telling them. He's just intimidated by me, because I know how things really work, and he can't push me into a corner and defeat me like he can my people."
ENFP,"How do you know if an ENFP is just being EXTREMELY nice, or if she's interested? I thought we were ""just friends,"" then after I brought up another girl to her, I just saw in her eyes that she was trying to hide extreme disappointment. We left each other, and I am just full of questions."
ENTP,"Well that question quickly got distorted  into a rant. As a male ENTP I can tell you that I try to be nice and do very much enjoy helping people. I'm a problem solver, and solving interesting problems is great for me personally. If I help people along the way it just makes it better by putting a weight behind it. I'm a bit less consistent when it comes to politeness: I'm very polite, sometimes even too polite (holding doors for streams of people, etc.), but I also run my mouth a lot (classic ENTP trait) and don't really give a fuck for people's sensitivities. I can be blunt and sarcastic but also very comforting. I can be loud and brash but I am often quite shy. ENTPs are walking, living, breathing contradictions. Also, not all female ENTPs on the web are jerks, just check out HarleyJinx for an example (too lazy to link her channel)"
ENTP,"@Mistress     Lol, the name's misleading.  Don't go off of that."
ESTP,"When you need to be around people or otherwise actively engaged at all times, or you start to go slightly insane."
ISFJ,"Another thing that makes it difficult is that I'm not a very organized person and don't consider myself pragmatic, which are things that appear to be common to every ISFJ description and SJs in general, and often times seem like the main aspects of SJ descriptions, so it's hard to tell if I'm just an unorganized/scatterbrained SJ, or if that would disqualify me from being an SJ  I overall relate to Si more though because I'm more detail oriented and focus a lot on the past, as the two main things. I was wondering if Enneagram may play a role also since ISFJ descriptions appear to be a combination of type 2, 6, and 9 ISFJs. "
ENFJ,"---    I feel like I could have written this almost word for word, so it feels like I've gotten something of my chest just reading this, so thanks Falling Leaves. I'll admit I don't really know how to help in this kind of situation because I have the exact same situation in my life I'm trying to figure out. I took a kinda drastic approach to these things."
ISTJ,"Rave: So I was really excited about only having one class today. I was looking forward to relaxing and cleaning. Then last night at the board meeting, they found out that I was the only board member who could do a service project today (ironically at the same time as my other class would have been). I was really disappointed to be losing that free time. However, I found out today that the service project is cancelled!"
ENTJ,Originally Posted by peoplesayimanahole   How would you deal if your partner that you love and care for and you know loves you and cares about you said they wanted to leave you because your relationship didn't align with their values and went against their religion?    You lost me at religion. Goodbye. Probably wasn't long- term sustainable anyways.
INFJ,Originally Posted by lemondropG   I've been on PerC all day.  It's probably time for me to get off.  Too much PerC makes me feel like this guy:     The Yellow Face! It burns us!
ENTJ,"I don't think I wrote a single research paper or essay all the way through grade school or college that didn't start with a brief anxiety attack, a bit of fear based procrastination, and finally a crammed 10 hour writing project that skipped most of the recommended steps and spat out information I'd gathered in a stream of consciousness."
ENTP,Originally Posted by MasterJediSoda    Anything you'd like me to pick up for you?    Can you get me an imagination? Please imagine as imaginative of an imagination as possible please.
ISFJ,"@Scoobyscoob  Looolllll, my husband told me about that Tsundere video and wanted me to see it. I kept forgetting, so when I saw it here I watched it right away. XD XD (That line about drawing kale made me laugh pretty loudly.)Sorry, that was totally off-topic. Would the Tsundere be ISFJ or INTJ, I wonder?"
ENFP,"I had an ENTP boyfriend and I talk from my experience that I hate how arrogant, self-centered and idiotic ENTPs can be. ENTPs care mainly about logic and disregard feelings as a laser thing that destroys your ability to think rationally, when it's not quite like that, at least not with ENFPs, we like logic as well. I also hate when ENTPs think that ENFPs are dumb because we're a F type. We are filled with emotional intelligence and wisdom. We love to know more and to explore and the high intelligence that many ENTPs have attracts me to them, even though my previous experiences repels me from them."
ESFP,"After we warm up to each other we can have some pretty cool conversations.      Originally Posted by anaraqueen   how do you guys deal with loneliness?

INTP,"The song, ""No Leaf Clover"" by Metallica feels like my fucking theme song right now..."
ESTP,"Things are getting a little too personal for my liking    I think it was Enigma who started calling you that .. and you know what, it fits "
INFJ,I once owned 7 different types of vacuums...all at once.      I have a Dyson.  You can suck up kindergarteners with a Dyson.  I love mine.
ENTP,Clearly this woman put diamonds on the soles of her shoes because she anticipated that her nemesis would be wearing armor.
INFP,"This is going to be the bravest thing I've ever done in my life, aside from challenging an entire gang of boys to a fight when I was 15. "
ESFP,"Unfortunately for me, I am addicted to INTJs so I spend a lot of time in category B. T_T    What is it about INTJ's that keeps you coming back?"
ISFJ,"I don't argue to win, I argue to sort everything out and reach some kind of middle ground or resolve.  If someone is arguing to ""win"", I walk away ... there is no point.  Funny I just posted a meme on FB the other day that read ""Pride is about who is right, Humility is about making it right.""    Do you think your way of seeing things is how an ISFJ would act? I feel like alot of ISFJ's are like you, sort of peace makers and avoidant of conflict. I am like that to some extent but not really. I don't know if my behavior has any correlation to MBTI so thats another hing..."

INFJ,Side note: the monkeysphere comes to mind when thinking of the effects of increasing numbers on this planet.    As far as I know countries with 'aging populations' have fertility rates close to the replacement level.
ENTP,"Originally Posted by christicake   If we met each other in a forest, what object(s) would you give me?    Picnic? "
ISTP,"This person I know, puts them at the end of EVERYTHING. It's so fucking annoying.    My boyfriend does that and I am quick to assume something is wrong. But when I ask and he says, ""Nah, I'm okay."" I'm just like, ""Then what the fuck is with the unnecessary ellipsis then?"""
ESTP,And yes I have two teenagers who he hasn't met because I haven't seen him in months. I am not planning to marry him without those interactions. I simply want the interactions to continue or for this to end. I don't like gray. 
INFP,I feel like shit and now I'm feeling slightly like I might throw up I really hope I don't
INFJ,"There was amusement in his eyes, but it still left me with that ""What am I doing with my life?!"" feeling."

ENFP,"Originally Posted by Arachnophiliax   How unfortu--BAH! -Ducks.- Hey, now! And here I thought you ENFPs were supposed to be nice people!    Mwhahahahhahahahahahah haha ha. Ha."
ESFP,Which BTW I think is completely unfair.  I've met people of all types who I'd consider to be utterly clueless about many things.
ISFJ,Some people really need your help to move on - but others just misuse it because they are lazy and unwilling to do their own stuff. It's not that they need it - it is just convenient for them to have it - that's all!
INFP,I'm going to work on it I'm going to try and not care what others think because If I enjoy something and love something then it's for the benfit of me not anyone else.
ESFP,"I've spent the past two years not thinking it was a big deal, but the nagging sense that something just wasn't right has been growing. Long story short, I actually found out over the weekend that there was a pretty big backstory about why he was just keeping tabs on what I was up to, and I will not be ever talking to him again. "
ISTP,"Goodness, my coworker would be tickled pink if he knew what kind of conversation this sparked!"

ISTP,"Virtually everything you decide today will be wrong. - Long, Dark Teatime of the Soul by Douglas Adams"
ISFJ,"She does this with almost everything, but what drives me really crazy is when she procrastinates with paying bills. It isn't like she has trouble paying them, she just doesn't get around to it until they are almost late, late, or someone threatens to send her to collections. "
INTP,Humans and other animals exposed to vacuum lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes

ENTP,"I suddenly understand why I am single. Not that I look like that, but I just assumed that all men were like my dad and brothers: it's all ok as long as it's not asymmetrical or ""too special""."
ESTJ,3. Own a motorcycle and a purebred German Shepherd named America. 
ENTJ,8w7.    How do you feel (or 'what do you think') about being 8w7? 
ISFJ,Honestly I would be too devastated if he did something stupid as I would imagine and I would blame myself if that happen.. as much as I wanted to help I can't and I learn how to just let go of my feelings and let him try to solve his own problem.. 
ISFP,"I guess one more thing I noticed comes from an observation of two friends who are married. He is an ISFP like me, and she is an INFP. She jokes that she is the ""finder"" and he is the ""loser"" because he (and I do this too) will often set down something he is holding and then forget that he set it down. She remembers him putting down the item, though he will not. I do the same thing, I will be holding a cup of coffee in my hand and then a minute later, realize that it is not in my hand. Most days, my classroom turns into a game of ""Help Ms. R find the thing she just had two seconds ago"". My students are very perceptive, all I have to do is look at my hand confused and one student will blurt ""It's right on the projector stand, Ms. R"" because they remember me putting it down, though I do not. My brain was elsewhere."
ENTP,"Anywas --- long story short --- when I finally do choose to get into a debate [it just takes a heck of a lot more coaxing than most other ENTP's I suppose], then I'm committed to it and can come back at it from any angle I want to. "

ESTP,Originally Posted by daleks_exterminate       I like this emoji...
ENTJ,"I think being the type to expect a certain reaction to every action is what derails some of us; we don't like deviations. Coming to terms that life is not an exact science is a slow process, and one that requires us to unlearn and relearn things. You'll make it because you have more tenacity than you know, and you'll look back on this as one of those journeys in life that others decided to skip because they were too scared or lazy to pursue."
ISFJ,"Or maybe that's just me..!    O!M!G! What you just wrote there! Yeah I like exclamation marks! No but really, yeah I can remember plenty of times I've done that."
INTP,"I really think I would like to work at a coffee shop sometime. It's not something that you might think would appeal to me, but it does for some reason.

ESTJ,"How about this...if you were going to go to jail for something in your lifetime, what do you think it would most likely be for?

I'd shoot/stab someone who was going to kill someone else, but I wouldn't just murder somebody who pissed me off. My rage is rarely personally fuelled that way. "
INTJ,"There are a number of shows (e.g. The Office - BBC) where it takes me days to get through an episode because I feel so much humiliation for people. Oh god. I have to keep pausing it and leaving to calm down. If it happens in person, oh frikkin help."
ISFP,"When in invisibility, and loneliness, I can sometimes be so unseen as to touch a stubborn way of life so that it doesn't even know I have changed its course, gentle like pulling a thorn from a lion paw.

What need for praise do I have anymore when I get to see something as beautiful as improvement?"
INTJ,"Are you willing to accept that your logical beliefs have no basis whatsoever, or do you in fact have a way of reconciling these epistemological dilemmas that have plauged philosophy for thousands of years, for which there appears to be no answer, classical nor contemporary?"
ISFJ,"One of the many exercises they had us do was to, at each of the five tables of staff, nominate a co-worker (present at the session or not) as a ""work-place hero.""  That is to say, as someone widely and profoundly appreciated, admired and respected in the work-place.  Out of the five nominations, I am sure that two were ISFJ and I suspect a third one was ISFJ as well.  Even at the other two tables, that ultimately went with other choices, they had discussed those same ISFJ's as possibilities."
ENTP,"Now that I think about it, I'm pretty positive ""Hey, fuck you"" has been the most repeated follow up response I've ever gotten when responding to someone."

You have to fall a few times. It may be helpful to try things you KNOW are socially unacceptable to figure out where they stand on the curve (you can tell based on the individuals around you and their reaction).    I dunno about that.

It doesn't really matter what you say, does it?  I imagine it's not worth it to try to convince him he's so wrong."
ISFP,Also why does the personalitypage descriptor say ISFPs may not have an easy life?    
ISFP,"I don't think the functions have much evidence, while the Big 5 have plenty of it and it's similar enough to MBTI when you use the four letters...

ENTJ,"Not procrastinating - if you don't have to work, then there's not much to procrastinate."
ESTJ,"Yes, he is quick to get angry, but he blows off quick, too. Once he told me that he had problems being perceived as aggressive and too serious, and said he wanted to be fun and easy-going like my other friends. He liked the control, sure, but this proves (well in my case) that ESTJ's aren't all about power and commanding respect. They wanna have fun too, but they're also serious when they need to be. We talked around and it was clear that he had principles, and that's very admirable. He reached the conclusion that he won't change just because other people wanted him to or because he wanted to be perceived differently. He knows what he is, and he'll stay true to himself."

INFP,"Would you say that you know what you believe but you can't find the right words for it.

It also made me call the 1st shift supervisor a fucking dick... because he was being a fucking dick, for no reason other than to be a fucking dick.  It was either call him a fucking dick or murder him in the hallway.  (I seriously considered murdering him, but... too many cameras & it would've been right in front of the control center.  Not the best of choices when it comes to locales for homiciding someone...)  "
INTP,"For all the rest, I can understand- and I mean that in the sense of Introvert is the opposite of Extrovert. Sensing is the opposite of Intuition. Judgement is the opposite of Perceiving. But is thinking really the opposite of feeling? That's what thought I've been chewing on whenever I come to the idea that maybe MBTI isn't fully accurate."
INFP,"Writing all that here is kind of helping me I guess so thank you INFP stream of conciousness thread, you are definately capturing my thoughts right now XD"
ESFP,"I want to state it's not a 'concern', by the way, it's just a possibility I'm quite interested in. Right now I'm writing a piece in Dutch, I'll try to capture the 'essence' of it later tomorrow to try and give a concise description of how I view myself outside of any typology framework.    As far as the enneagram/MBT combo goes rest assured that it is plausible (and is also probably why you are a little confused). However, if you want to find out your Myers Briggs type it would be best not to mention your enneagram type until after they've typed you. When I don't tell people my Myers Briggs they say I'm 5w4, when I don't tell them my enneagram they say I'm ESFP, but when I tell them ether I'm something else entirely (let's face it, people are incapable of not being biased).

She didnt have experience in this area, but I thought she was very smart and competent and knowing she was an ENTJ, I was excited that she would take charge of the situation and help bring her team up to more modern best practices.  Instead she started firing people who disagreed with her, taking every chance she could behind closed doors to say bad things about my teams and over and over again saying we were ""not empathic"".  This confused me, as we would be requested to absorb additional work, when we didnt have the resources to do so...not 10% more work, but like 600% more work.

Instead he's been playing really average stuff. I've been trying everything to make him see how irrational that is, using lots of analogies, logical explanations, metaphors, hypothetical scenarios etc. and still no result. Is there any reason for this? Why would someone look forward to something so much only to forget/ignore its existence? One of those games he predicts will be his all-time favourite but still hasn't actually started it. By contrast, that very same game (which I laughed at initially) I bought and played while it was on sale and did everything on it even though I had no interest in it other than to see what all the fuss was about. Can someone explain it to me?    He wants to play many things and has they come out/he buys them they start pilling up and he moves on to play something he is more interested in at the moment.

My father is an ESFJ and not even he is that annoying."
ISFP,"If you are still in this relationship and are still facing the same problems and want some advice. I'd start with looking honestly at what good experiences she does give you physically or any way in life and thank her for them. Even a good sexual experience. It will make her feel like she is capable of giving a good experience even though she probably knows giving good experiences is usually your thing. (Even though it is your thing, she is totally capable of giving good ones too). Don't be afraid to ask for them too. She would probably feel overjoyed. If you told her ""I want [fill in the experience],"" her extraverted Intuition will kick in and she will probably do what you want. There is no shame in wanting good experiences from her. It's just telling her you want her to give them to you in a non-critical way. I think pointing out all the ways she gives you a good experience physically by her looks will motivate her to believe in herself. And us ISFPs and INFPs, when we believe something, we will make it happen. So trust that by telling her she is amazing in all the ways you have believed she is amazing, even in old photos of how good she looked, she'll totally get there eventually."

What people dont know does not hurt, which means you do not have to tell them anything lol just lie.. But as long as you give back to those that help you i see no problem or atleast trying to make something of yourself. IF a women was smart she would do the same and you both can build profit together. "

Ni is trying to create a mental map where every personality type has its own place. I try to put myself into the shoes of the people around me and perceive the world through the lens of their dominant functions. Sometimes, I sit at a table with friends of different types and I imagine Ni, Ne, Fi, Fe, Ti, Te, Si, Se all coming out of people and interacting with each other in different ways as the topic of the conversation changes. It is of course more challenging with types whose function order is very different from mine, but it is really interesting as well. My mood is also very important in relation to how I perceive the overthinking process.

INFP,"Should I blame the universe? An explanation about how some people just draw the short straw on destiny could alleviate my mind. But I am human, and couldn't help but ponder what that would mean. Did that deem me nothing but some sort of flailing particle in the wind being dragged by the current? I am human and I need identity. I needed identity more than most too. I craved it. So being nothing but dust just made me feel worse and question more. Even if I blamed her- it still hurt. But if I held the weight on my shoulders- it hurt too, just not right away. I want to be strong and prove I am by holding up. But when I collapse, can I blame her for that? Gravity would always be the enemy. And weightlessness would always be the goal. ""The unloveable soul would be "" Rhetorical questions was the gravity in this instance. But it's all too literal, and I have too many metaphors without the tangible to attach itself. I have meaning without a place. All these actions don't mesh well with the poem in my mind. And there's the discord, I can hear it again. But of course, I didn't hear any thing but silence. Even the voice, was a loophole into a sea of imagined everything."
ISFP,"I've thought about it for a while now, and it's thought that reoccurs ever so often, but what is my personality. I've been put on quite a few facades, or ""personas"" for other people, and I seem to have a different personality with every person I happen to interact with. There are my intellectual friends whom I indulge in all sorts of theoretical and scientific debate and discussion with, others who I'm much more ""outgoing"" and silly around, people I'm reserved with, others where I'm more casual, the rest rather dignified... And, on top of all of this, having a personality disorder that completely warps me within a matter of minutes certainly doesn't help."
INTJ,"Put differently, extroverts need other people in order to extrovert, and introverts can introvert on their own.    I think that is correct, however you have to look at the reason WHY people prefer 'doing it alone' or 'doing it together' - I think it comes down to preference which is based on where people gain the most energy. ie extroverts will prefer being with people because by themselves they feel drained and depressed, and introverts are the opposite. Of course if your values/goals differ then you could be an introvert and say 'lets do it together', you'll just need time out at some stage to recharge."

And yeah, I bought them. I still like those songs, but I don't like what she's put out since then. Her ""Born This Way"" that came out in March is very bland, she's selling it completely on the idea that people will turn it into an anthem. It almost sickens me as a musician that she would write a song and sell it purely with marketing techniques and not on musical quality. And her song ""Judas"" came out in April. That song is purposely offensive, she wrote it and marketed it with that intention alone. Why else would she release the song on Good Friday and then release the music video on Easter? Because she had to market it on Good Friday, she missed The Day of Silence, an important day in the gay community. That was a community I thought she supported. Apparently insults are more worth her time than supporting people. Her marketing used to be a way to get her music out there, her music was very unique originally.

INTP,Can't do it very often though cause it does burn me out but I'd be going out like that once a week if it was actually reasonable to.

ENFJ,I have built a genuinely happy life.  I am not willing to risk it.
INTP,"For all the rest, I can understand- and I mean that in the sense of Introvert is the opposite of Extrovert. Sensing is the opposite of Intuition. Judgement is the opposite of Perceiving. But is thinking really the opposite of feeling? That's what thought I've been chewing on whenever I come to the idea that maybe MBTI isn't fully accurate."

ISFJ,I was also wondering if ISFJ's tend to lean towards enneagram type 2 often?
INFJ,I want to be more like ESTPs. Bet fewer of them die from stress related illnesses than most other types.

ISTP,"I said my wife had. He then proceeded to explain, in detail, his special process for making it. Each step. What do to while I'm waiting for things to sit. How to make the side dishes that go along with it. All in a very calm, friendly voice like he was on a cooking show and it was completely natural to be doing so. I stood there in the heat next to my car in the loading zone nodding and listening, all the while wondering what was up with this guy. I noticed his huge frame and his huge hands. His seemingly overly-calm nature only added to the weirdness of it. I kept on wondering if he was going to suddenly yell and run at me and attack me, but outwardly I only appeared interested in what he had to say. I was wondering if something wasn't right in his head and so I didn't know what to expect. I watch lots of crime drama shows and often the serial killer will have some odd way of catching his victims. One of the possibilities I thought of was that this was his way of trying to get the person off their guard by having a friendly conversation with them. Then he would make up some kind of excuse for me to get in his car. Of course, this was all my imagination and I didn't give any more weight to this possibility than any other. I was ready for anything while not letting it affect my friendliness nor the amount I accommodated him."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by twyndelhen   Totally agree with this!!! Plus, I feel like I haven't read near enough poetry to even *begin* to do true justice to the question...

ISFJ,"The function of Lysine involves calming the serotonin receptors in the intestinal tract, which is important because the Vagus Nerve in the human body connects our digestive tract directly to our brain, making us quite sensitive to the goings on of our colons pretty much all the time. When the Vagus Nerve has been cut in test subjects, anxiety is also markedly diminished, but this isn't a remedy- as research, it merely established how important gut health is in relation to mood and anxiety."

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by teddy564339   Here's where I'm really confused though, almost to the point of wanting to retract my earlier statement:  Based on me, everything I said about ISFJ's is true.  But, I've read a good bit on here about people having problems with ISFJ's because the ISFJ comes across as cold, or uncaring, or not wanting to be around people different than them, or things like that.    I've been told that I come across as stuck up at first. Naturally it hurt my feelings, but after some introspection I realized that it's because I'm not as outgoing as most people I worked with. If I don't have anything interesting or relevant to say, I won't say anything. I'm just bad at small talk because it has no centralized goal to it...it's mind-numbingly awkward to me, so I avoid it. Avoiding small talk comes across as not wanting to talk at all and...yeah, I think that's where they get it from."
INTJ,Accountability is a characteristic not a lot of people have.
ISFJ,"For an ISFJ, (especially younger) their Si attacks their Ne. ISFJs need structure. Routine. To others, especially Ne-doms, they can come off as boring. An ISFJ who develops their Ne, will be more inclined to experiment so long as they appease their need for structure. Planning. Looking up reviews. Research. Letting them now a week in advance instead of the day of. (I am trying not to do this to my SO anymore.)"
INTJ,I'm not that fussed by a couple of mistakes here and there as much as I used to be. I feel even better if I compare to the majority of writing pretty much anywhere on the netz.
ENFP,"I know ENFP's can be impulsive, was this just an impulse based on fear? She had been telling me she was scared of where we were going as we were getting serious (even though she pushed me to go there)."

ENFP,"I don't know about other ENFPs, but it is EXTREMELY difficult to make me angry.  One has to pretty much threaten me physically, though there have been rare (two) exceptions in my life.  One involved lack of integrity coupled with deceit that could have put me in danger, the other was a person who tried to kill themselves and then got pissed off at me when they found themselves alive in the hospital the next day because I intervened.  My response was ""If you want to get out of your hole, I'll do anything to help you; but if you want to dig yourself deeper into your own hole, then you're on your own.""  In both cases, I calmly, firmly, and briefly told the person that I was angry, EXACTLY why I was angry, and then I was simply DONE with them.  Forever.  It takes so much to get me angry, that once I'm angry, that's it -there's no reason to interact with that person ever again.  I forgive quickly, but never give the person another chance to repeat their mistake with me.  :/  "

ESFP,  I'm always worried the exact opposite. I think I probably come on too hard and fast which makes you withdraw. Or I think you'll find me really boring or trivial. Obviously we should all just get over our fear of being boring and hug it out.    
ESTP,ESTPs love the chase    Women like the old bate and switch. It gets them addicted. I like making fun of girls for my own amusement and playing around. It works pretty well.

Then she will come out to see him. She also mentioned that she was offering her virginity to him and thats why she had to prepare herself for their first meet.

INFP,"What do I want from this life?  I want someone to believe that this clueless lump of meat with far more self respect than my appearance conveys is more concerned with their happiness and wellbeing than my own.  Spending money is the only way I know to express appreciation as that's how it's always been in my family, I hate money.  The funniest thing I've done this year was to try and act out emotions - I can act happy, sad, angry... but when it came to acting love I just stood there with a bemused look on my face.  The thing I value most I literally have no idea what it is.  Yet the first person I ""know"" I could make happy is not here.

ISTP,"This morning I found an anonymous note under my door complaining about loud music, and how the writer needs to get up at 2 am for work (what do they do? Flight attendant? Construction worker? Sex worker?) I mean, really, talk about passive aggressive. So I write a note to the neighbors who live next door and just above and below me. My first draft was somewhere along the lines of    "

INFP,"As a child I was extremely active, almost to the point of extroversion, but looking back I can still see the INFP traits. I had lots of friends and was quite popular at the really nice school that I went to. I would spend my summers playing in the bush and building cubby houses. It was great. But then I went to high school. The high school I attended was very rough and violent. As a shy sensitive person who had never been exposed to this kind of violence I found it very difficult to deal with. I went inside my shell and became extremely introverted. I developed many mental and social complexes. Once before school some people who claimed to be ""just out of jail"" stole our money and hit us with a chain with a large padlock on the end of it. After this incident I was scared to go outside for a long time and developed a strong distrust for people."

ENTP,"When entps get excited do you tend to swing your feet (when sitting in a chair)? I know one entp (at least I think he's entp) and he swings his feet a lot when he's talking about something.

INTJ,"Originally Posted by The March Cat   YES!!!! I also DESPISE Biology. I think it comes from the fact that while in other sciences you actually have to solve for things, everything in Biology is assumed to be true. It's all about memorization and learning all the unnecessary technical jargon. I'd much rather solve a complex physics problem than be forced to memorize 20pgs of a Biology textbook any day.    I was also under the same impression while I was doing biology in high school. In college, however, it's something that is more than memorizing everything. I've seen many people around me who relies on memorizing the fact instead of understanding and drawing their own connections between principles learned. And guess what? They failed miserably. "
ISFJ,"3. The pestering itself has gotten to her. Especially if she has any childhood memories of being reprimanded for not doing certain things. If that's the case, no amount of pestering will ever help, it will just set her avoidance in further. Instead you would need to take a positive-only approach, without directly confronting the problem but sidestepping it and making her feel better about her ability to perform in that task."
ENTP,"1) if there were a fifth law of thermodynamics, what would it be?"
INFP,"I think to myself iif I told my brother or friends this they'd immediately try to alter my thought process to something a little more ""elevating"" yet there's no dismissing it. And by no means am I calling everyone in my town and the general area the dreaded word (again in my eyes) racist, it's just a fact of life that this is the disposition that some people have."

ISFJ,"You guys are really liked, admired and appreciated!  I'm guessing people probably don't tell you often enough, though.  Trust me, they think it!    "
ISFJ,"Interesting. I was wondering based on my ISFJ's experience in life. He really feels a need to conform to what his friends and family like or do. Honestly, I think he just feels out of place in the world and is looking for his ""right thing to do."""
ISTP,"I swear, I'll laugh at anything. Last night someone jokingly said that men born around the same time we were  (1982, 1983, 1984) are all dogs, pigs, and rats, and I couldn't stop laughing after that (also the glass of wine I had helped)."
ENTP,"If ENTPs became endangered, would the ENTP hivemind take over the other personalities?"
ISTP,"I hunt, almost religiously. Except in California. Because it's a bunch of liberal asshats and people look at your like you're an ax murderer the second you mention hunting. I don't find it cruel in the least bit. It's typically crueler NOT to hunt them. I mean, have you ever seen what happens when animals get overpopulated? It's saddening. Imagine deer, everywhere, but they look as skinny as an Ethiopian. Walk through the woods and find a deer, dead from starvation. Plus, fuck y'all. Deer meat is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better (and more humane) than beef will ever be. So yea, you might as well go vegetarian if animal cruelty is the main thing you have against hunting."
ESTJ,"i can only speak on friendship level. i have 2 intjs friends. i just accept them as they are. their ti and my te clash, but i just let that be. i think in a romantic relationship it would drive me crazy to always be clashing on a logical consistency basis.    You're Te clashes with an INTJs Ti? INTJs have tert Te, do you mean INTPs? Because INTJs have tert Te. I can imagine INTJs getting along quite well with ESTJs so long as they are working towards the same goal/have the same vision and similar values. Otherwise it would not work. I suspect that INTJs will still respect ESTJs dom Te and ESTJs would respect INTJs vast intellect and forward thinking/goal setting. I know my boyfriend respects a lot of E*TJs I can only imagine him being in purposeful friendships with them however, I would suspect romantic relationships are a bit more rare. ESTJs can be a little to set in their ways for INTJs I think so relationships can be a bit harder to develop initially."

ISTP,"About fed up with working for the typical workplace. Oh look, no work to do? clean up. I clean like a fucking beast and finish 3 hour jobs in 30 minutes due to efficiency. Immediately get told to quit standing and clean more. Know what? this is a fucking workshop not a fucking emergency room. Want to bitch at me for doing nothing after I make the place fucking spotless? send me home then. And this is why capitalist business sense makes no fucking sense. everything is about saving money yet they go about all the wrong fucking ways, such as not sending people home when they are completely done with everything, letting machines break down to the point of needing 100% replacement instead of properly maintaining them, etc etc. Next time it happens I swear I am going to have the urge to go crush some infants in the injection molders, or at the very least break things."
ENTP,"Anyways we tried being friends afterwards but it didnt take. Lasted a couple of months. Didnt really get along with each others friends and went on to do our own thing. Met some in my classes and about the same thing happened.  So i guess that's the thing. I get along great with them when we are forced to be around each other, but that's usually as far as it goes. Not a friendship that has lasted. Not for me at least."

ESTJ,"My friend(from above, same one) definitely chews people out she gets annoyed with.. in front of everyone.  Two of my guy friends are freaked out by her/hate her now."
INTJ,"If he hadn't forced me to stay (The guy actually went so far as to hold my bike back when I wanted to go), we wouldn't ever have made that friendship which we both gained from in the end. What do you have to offer her?"
INTP,"On another note I find myself a social conservative among my peers in the regards, that I'm probably clinging onto old social norms that when among them see outdated, and worn like a pair of faded curtains. Probably because the party the night before showed me the amount of lesbian, and sexually promiscuous friends they have.    Things would've really changed for me if I'm not in the wrong country. I really should get the hell outta here ASAP."
INFJ,"Me:  No.  You can't always know what's right.  But that doesn't mean there isn't a right, it just means you don't know what it is and you choose to make a gray area so you don't feel guilty for making the wrong choice. "
ESTP,But I've noticed that you've since changed your tag from ESTP to INFJ and was wondering why that was. I know that the INFJ is our subconcious and it's what we want to become. We aspire to be good at using our Ni but it's also where our insecurities lie.

ISFJ,Originally Posted by windholms   I have an ISFJ friend who I enjoyed talking to.
ESTP,"I have dated an ESTP before and am dating one now. What I have seen is that as soon as they know that I am interested, they start playing games of looking busy/unavailable. Its not that they are ignoring/neglecting me or anything because they will be talking and showing interest, etc, but they seem to like being chased when it comes to dating."
ESTP,Kicked the habit of lying. Takes more guts to be honest and is challenging and rewarding on a whole other level.
ESTJ,"Not all stereotypes have to be negative, though. I'm an INFP and my husband is an ESTJ and some of the positive stereotypes are the things I value most about his contribution to our relationship: I never feel emotionally insecure with him because he is loyal, steady and dependable and always fulfills his promises and obligations. His emotional steadiness makes a nice bedrock foundation for me to anchor myself during flights of fancy or emotional stress. On the other hand, where he tends to be authoritative in the raising of our children, he often confers with me about discipline and drawing lines and nurturing them so that he can do right by them and not be a bully or overbearing."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Serenitylala   Thor's not an evil guy... Can't kick him. Lol. But Loki's behind is fair game. That and there's something fun abt his personality, he makes me laugh.

ESFP,"Originally Posted by Yeahright   For sure. Extraverted sensing, well it's hard to describe for me because it's just like how I am...I don't know how it is for intuitives but I have heard it is common for Ns to run into stuff and trip a lot because they are always thinking about stuff. I am pretty aware of my environment though yeah. I guess it is like driving. It is being aware of multiple things at once and reacting to all of them quickly. So if someone is coming too close to my car I will instinctively ""feel"" them near me and move away, and I will notice if someone ahead of me in the next lane is looking over, which means they are trying to get into my lane, and I will instinctively speed up and block them from getting in haha. I am also very sensitive to people and things touching me, so I get very bothered if like something is touching my foot or something, it will really irritate me and I can't ignore it."
INFP,"Remember, this is a venting thread. Not a place to defame other users or protest or anything of that matter. The reason for this is because it disrupts the flow of the thread. It can also create a lot of hostility which can spread throughout the boards, and I don't think that's a desirable outcome for anyone."
INFP,"I choose happiness over money also which is something that most people don't understand. When I told my aunt that my dream was to become a writer she basically laughed at me and told me to stop dreaming because you didn't get much money from writing books. I don't care, I don't give a damn because at least I would be happy and considering that we life only once (I am hoping that we don't though) I would rather die knowing that I was happy and maybe poor then  unhappy and having spent my life in some job that I hated just so I could be rich.

INTJ,"Now, if you don't forgive them I believe this could lead to other negative consequences such as ill health, increased stress hormones, anger etc. (I'm sure there are studies, I tried to find a few but couldn't access them online). Not only that but unforgiveness can lead to revenge and further immoral acts. Which could be bad for you, and society."
INFP,"I talked awhile back about how I wanted to go back to therapy, but I'm afraid to talk to her again. I 'stopped' seeing her by never turning up at our next appointment.

If I only wanted attention, please lah, I could do it so much more easily in real life and you know it. Why do you think I can be so vague when I talk about my feelings? I don't show my real self 100% online, I don't get attached easily. Plus I don't remember being too harsh in judging anybody, except for a few enemies who hurt me in real life and except when I sense bigotry."

I only know of one confirmed ENTP female. I cannot say whether it is her personality or something else, but she is a very striking, strong, and attractive woman. However, I've never attempted to be anything more than a friend with her. Just never had any interest in doing so, which is not the norm with me when it comes to members of the opposite sex. We make good friends and would most likely make great business partners, if the two of us ever had a chance to do so."

Sometimes I procrastinate too much but still doing it. and I have a BIG crush to one of my guy friend/a best friend of opposite gender. He's ESTP by the way. I think it's because I love to see how he's so happy with his surrounding wherever he go, and how he actually understand my point. But, I don't want to risk losing my friendship between him just because of this, as we're too young to talk about love/relationship."

ENTP,"It seems the older I get, the better I get at being able to present my point in regards to this, but it still takes some courage and consideration and picking the right moment.    When  I expect an emotional outburst, it's because that's what I am aiming for. Though I can easily relay gentleness, I prefer doing a verbal slap o the face. It's much more effective. Thus, I don't wait for the right moment, as I want the verbal slap to be quite a shock, making the target realise just how annoying and/or stupid they are acting"

If life has taught me anything, it's that the truth isn't worth two shits to most people. They want to feel good and meaningful, not harmonious. Because harmony requires readjustment, and readjustment doesn't care about your values or your upbringing, or the chaos it may instill in your lifestyle.

ESFJ,4. You seem to honestly care about people who you don't even know. You are generally interested in how they might be feeling.
ISFJ,"It could be worse, for example when ENFP or INFP believe they understand where I'm coming from without me ever acknowledging or refuting it, and then suddenly they see or hear me say something that appears to contradict their understanding of who they believed me to be (their mistake, not mine) and their behavior toward me totally flips in an instant. I think it's the major drawback of Te's ""all or nothing"" attitude, especially when it's tertiary or inferior and Fi precedes it."
ISFJ,"and to add..You know youre an ISFJ when you know you give someone a great gift and the greatest reward is the ""thank you."""
ENFP,"Originally Posted by ENTrePreneur   How does one write a letter to an ENFP of interest? Many might call this a ""love"" letter, but I have not any feelings and may need excessive coaching on this process.    If they're of interest, you probably have feelings... "
ISFJ,"But after all these thoughts is the seeking out their view point and figuring out that the friends they chose to spend the time with are good for them, AND BEGINNING TO FEEL GUILTY FOR BEING ANGRY AND UPSET THAT THE PLANS CHANGED LAST MINUTE."
ISFP,"Oh and if you have to choose between these 2 options below, which would you choose?"
INFJ,"The only frustration for the day was trying to set up my dad's new Win8 laptop... after he'd fucked about with it.

Why he thought he should try to sort it himself, I'm not sure... old people.  "

ESTJ, How do you react when you see unrealistic things in historical movies or movies that are suppose to present some sort of realism?
INFP,"Just in case anyone was wondering, if you haven't cried in a really long time, sometimes the salt in your tears can sting enough to keep you from crying further. It can thus perpetuate the cycle of not releasing your tears and increasing the need to cry, but also increasing the time between each attempt making the pain worsen. It's almost as though Irony and her good friend Contradiction are laughing at me right now."
ISFP,"I think perhaps we have trouble understanding one other because our brains are wired so differently. Lol our infj brains by default read and analyze people and sometimes isfps dont give us much to go on, verbally or otherwise. And just when we think we've figured things out we find out we're wrong. Its not just isfps though, i seem to have trouble understanding all SPs. I think it may be due to the fact that SPs are completely in the here and now, and my thoughts are either 10 years in the past or 15 years in the future. Half the time I'm vaguely aware that the sun it out. "

Think of Nintendo with the amiibos, claimed to have a limited supply and people went crazy trying to buy them because they were ""rare."" "

Perhaps we do it because it's the best, most  reliable way of doing things. I guess it depends on the thing we are  discussing. "

The UK or Singapore, both would be great options for mine and my partners work, similar culture, both excellent for frequent travel.3. What 3 traits would you say are most important to you in a relationship? Emotional intimacy, dependability and commitment. That means committing to me, the relationship, and our future.

Funny thing is, I'm a bit like that too but I never saw that coming in a party guy like him.    Fi is a tricky function to handle if you don't experience it yourself.  It needs space and time.  My husband is INTP, you believe or not, the only source for our problems is this Fe and Fi, unlike commonly known as S and N problem, Ti doesn't bother people as long as it is left alone.  Fe bothers me a lot, to be honest, it is very demanding.  Fortunately, there isn't much Fe in our case, so we get along very well most of the times."
INTJ,"Part of this is social conditioning, in my case, and probably more than average given my family, but I find that in a lot of cases, I will put up with things from people because I know they cannot have a sensible conversation about it. I won't bring things up about them that bug me, because they blow up in my face at the slightest hint of criticism. So I just find a way to adapt to the inconveniences they cause me, since it is less work than trying to communicate with them. Yet I, on the other hand, am an easy person to criticise, and don't take vengeance for it. So I create an environment where others are more able to feel comfortable bringing their issues to me - as much as their own personality permits, anyway."

Alright so here's my shot at articulating this accurately. Language is merely a tool to convey thought, if you cannot articulate how you feel the most fundamental reason and root reason would be, do to a lack of understanding of what it is you feel consciously. We all understand emotion on the subconscious level, I mean emotion is the subconscious trying to communicate to the conscious mind what it is thinking. "

So It makes sense to try to be thoughtful of everyone's different needs and ways of doing things.

Like take an ESFJ, they can have similar tendencies, and yet each one has been raised differently and so will react differently than other ESFJ's.  Not to discount what you are saying, I understand what you are saying, I mean I couldn't live with an INTP.

Well, we *are* strongly growth-oriented, and earlier on that can take the form of novelty. What's wrong with crushes if not acted on?

ISFP,"My favorite kind of marmot is the Vancouver Island Marmot. This is a species that nearly went extinct and has made a remarkable comeback thanks to the efforts of the Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Foundation. They are monogamous and live in family groups. At one point their populations were fairly isolated and they were very territorial and aggressive but as the population has grown and stabilized a more gregarious, kindly and tolerant side has been revealed. Family is quite important to these lovely creatures and young may stay on with their parents for a few years before dispersing to find mates. They are very unique-looking marmots, a gorgeous chocolate brown with white noses and speckled white tummies. "

Oh and told me she was waiting at home on Friday, and let's not forget yesterday when he went out."
ENTJ,"But yes, she does over-do on the makeup. This is one area where Hollywood sets the standard, like you've mentioned. Kardashians, Cheryl Cole, even Cher for that matter, are all natural beauties, yet their obsession with cosmetics is blaring obvious.

So in that respect the gravitational pull of the earth certainly is 'like a magnet'. Hence, also, my later, and apostrophised, use of 'magnetism' in continuation of my description. "

I never really saw it as a means to express myself, though. Even though I've been artistic all of my life I have recently realized that I've always taken a very mathematical approach to it. I suppose it's a compromise between logic and aesthetics - I get to use my logic to solve problems and create timeless solutions that I can actually feel proud about, that everyone will see and understand even if they don't fully understand the amount of work that was put into it."

At parties and large group togethers (we sit together and chat) and he asks to sit with him (now it is automatic, we always sit together) & we drink. Though he has NEVER initiated a one-to-one hang out with me (i.e just going for coffee or sight-seeing and so on). YET he often asks me, ""what are you doing tomorrow?"", I usually say I have no fixed plans, but have a few things going but can be available. Why doesn't he initiate one-to-one time with me?

Maybe that person who's helping you out of the hole you're in - maybe you're living by that person's terms. "

Constantly challenging someones view or value is extremely draining and unnecessary in our eyes. With Fi included, this can make us.......not be around you. We dont mind a challenge, constantly doing it is going over the line though. With inferior Fi, it can be hard to express this while someone like INFP or ISFP will express this immediately and just.......drop you. Values are not something to be logically explained; it just is and whoever doesnt like it has to deal with it. We can only explain why we value it, nothing more, nothing less. Ex: I value babies. Why? because they are cute, intelligent, full of potential, interesting, strong, adorable, and loving. When you love them, they give love in return and you know its genuine and your love will be returned. Thats it. That being said, goodluck trying to get an INFP, ISFP to share their values lol."

He just could not accept accept the fact that I had another opinion and kept on repeating his ""reasoning"" and did not understand that there could be more than one viewpoint on it. He believed I was refusing to think while that was not the case... Anyhow, even the next morning he repeated his arguments while I already had said in a calm way that I had another opinion and that I did not want to talk more about it. He did not listen and went on until I really blew up and yelled that he had to shut up. The whole house must have heard that. After that I just ignored him for a while. I don't think he could have done much to make me feel like talking to him. Maybe say he was sorry for being so pushy and disrespectful... I think for me it's very important to know that I can give any opinion I like without that it will be used against me or without that someone will try in a pushy way to persuade me of something else. I have no problems with a calm rational discussion though."

This is why I hate confrontation, because I can't take anymore negative criticism and understanding what to do with it.

ESFJ,"- To them, lack of a response from the person(s) accompanying/trying to interact with is taken personally. They think that the person doesn't like them or isn't having fun. Common questions are ""are you okay?"" ""Why are you so quiet?"""

ESTP,"Originally Posted by HermioneG   ESTP and truth vs. lying:  In what situations do you lie?  Do you sugar coat things? Or alter the truth just a bit to get what you want?    I don't think I lie so much as I just let someone think what they wanna think depending on what the subject is. I may not always tell everything information wise but I will give you my thoughts on something, very straight forward. Also a tendency to jump in and sort things out after the fact although I do try to be forward thinking. Learn more threw trial and error than anything else."

INTP,"Originally Posted by nadjasix   The thing about uppers is they make people insanely narcissistic and self-absorbed, so that's the downside. Honestly, if I had to choose, I'd rather be related to a heroin addict than a stimulant addict. Junkies at least know they're addicts and don't pretend they're not self-destructive. It takes a lot of BS for a stimulant addict to realize they have a problem.    True. I've known/know a few cocaine addicts. Always have to go to the bathroom every five minutes then talk my ear off. Then when I see them do it they always make the excuse that it's a special occasion or some shit. Stimulant addicts can generally live a productive life if they get their fix while heroin addicts have to retreat. So, in terms of what would be the most preferable addiction (if I can say that), I would say that if you're addicted to stimulants, at least you can be functional. Though if you're coming at it from what type of addict would be less bothersome on you, then I suppose a heroin addict would be preferable."

INTJ,"Ha, the only thing I really read is fiction. My mind likes to live in the places of the imagination and creativity. I just find books based on modern times boring and uninteresting. Unless it's a subject that I'd really like to learn about, there's little chance of me reading something real."

INTJ,"Originally Posted by killerB   Ok, my eldest is an INTJ.  She's 19, almost 20, and so far does not show much interest in dating.  She didn't in highschool, wanting to focus on her studies instead, she's now in college, and focusing on becoming a Microbiologist.  My wife is also INTJ, and only dated, including me, 4 people her whole life.  Is this a normal MO for INTJs?  Do they have a tendancy to date late or not much at all?  I know there are jokes about INTJs not being able to find their sex organs much less wanting to use them, but now I am wondering about it.  (BTW once you guys figure out how to use them, it's quite fantastic   ;)   )    Didn't date until I was 23. Didn't really see the point, honestly. I didn't see the point at 23 either, but I had just switched meds and I was more unstable and reckless than usual. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't worth keeping up. Met someone else at 25, and I hope it sticks because I hate dating - and he's awesome. Relationships are fine, dating is too smalltalky and all that horrible social crap. I like to be able to take someone for granted, to a degree. Doesn't mean I won't put work into a relationship, but I like a certain amount of trust the work will be purposeful and that they are worth it. This is not an area in which I like risks. It's kind of like an extension of introversion for me - like since socialising isn't energy-giving in itself, you need a reason to participate - well, relationships are even more draining, so you need a better reason. I'm sure some of us can handle the casual and distance, but I always take things 'too' seriously, so I couldn't. It helped that almost none of my friends dated either - not that peer pressure changes much, but it is irritating. Also, it's not like I noticed people flirting with me anyways. It never really occurred to me to pay attention."

The National is AMAZING and always helps me when I'm having a rough day  (I personally love 'Baby We'll Be Fine'). I think a lot of the  disconnect btw ENFJs and other types is that we are so upfront about our  emotions and other types find this strange or unnatural, so they don't really know how to react when we come at them with our honesty. Some of your anger may be related to insecurity, but perhaps some is due to misunderstanding? The people that know me best know how to communicate without hurting my feelings. When I get upset at other people I remind myself that most of them don't mean harm, and the ones that do mean harm are probably unhappy and sad people anyways"

INFJ,"Context of this case might make it clearer--the joker was known to  be married, not homosexual, and the jokes were more flirtatious and  in-your-face than just harmless-snicker jokes like in the Humor Me  thread. In that light, a guy doing that makes me start worrying that  cheating, stalking, a nasty divorce for the current wife, etc, is in the  cards, while from a girl, it's still a ""whoa"" head-turn, but more  ""the strange things people do"" worthy than anything. If the roles were reversed and it was a girl making the pushy  jokes to guys while being married, I'd get the same red flagging."

But, my husband does not treat me like a slave nor do I feel like a slave. It may be viewed as such to others outside of who I am, but for me, I am a person who lives to care for my husband and vice versa.

It's not like I ignore him or anything I always try to show him love and respect but it just seems like it's not enough. it's driven me crazy but I just try to deal with it. Is this an ENTJ trait or is he just odd?    That sort of behavior sounds very unlike me. I don't manipulate people for attention and I certainly don't look to create drama as I hate drama to be honest. I'd say that's an oddity specific to your dad because I don't like to seek attention nor do I like to manipulate people. If I do, it's damn well for good reasons and not something that's kind of selfish like wanting more attention from my child."

But after that, I realized that I was letting my mother control and manipulate me. I don't think she was aware of it--this was her biggest weakness. She depended on her children, for them to give her emotional stability, rather than being that emotional rock for us. It was, to be honest, pathetic. I didn't understand that for another 30 years or more, but I _felt_ it. After my fiasco, and realizing I was still alive, I realized that I didn't need to allow her to determine my reaction. To put a single word on it, I forgave her--internally. And to be honest, I've had to return to that multiple times. "

For example,since rich people do not tend to wear synthetic fiber and only wear natural fabric, you decided to do the same, but you give a reason doing it for as an environmental and ecological reason.   Also you should not discard your cloth quickly, but wear it to death, and make sure they are well tended for as well.  Using of dryer is not adivisable, therefore.  "

Flip side of that is though that if the other person is truly in love with you that they won't want you to sacrifice anything for them...I remember I had to give up a few of my friends to keep my relationship with my ex going. I offered to do it and he pretty much told me I better do it if I had any love for him. (Now, I have since apologized to my friends and some of us have become friends again. But I don't think I'll ever do that for a lover again...I think that was red flag #1 he was going to be abusive). But yeah basically, if someone truly loves you they won't ask you to give up anything for them...IMO at least. If you do it willingly and then they ask why you did it all aghast and shocked, there's a much greater chance of them being in luuuurrrrve with you.

ESFP,"I've been citing information directly from common sites [without naming source, yes, because it's literally common typology knowledge on the first and second pages of google] for typology and it's functions and you seem to disagree with most of them, so unfortunately I'm faced with three possibilities here:    What you posted here was straightforward praise for Ne-Fi to be honest. Now if you read traits of people with high intelligence then you will see in ehat way Ne-Fi users were praised there. I disagree on typing people by their abilities. Person can have good iNtuition and good Sensing, just one is preffered. It's a witchcraft. Sorry, but I really have to take back N to reality a bit and make it as worthy as Sensing.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by Lord Pixel   I wish I could be more ISFP than infp.    Being an ISFP is nothing special. If you want to be an ISFP because they are supposedly more practical and down to earth, well, that is just a myth. We are dreamers as well. It is a Fi-dom thing."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by freezeframe   My dad doesn't feel bad though. Because he's never wrong. Because he's moralistically superior to all. And if I oppose him, he'll go off on a lecture or a rant or something and its not worth it because then he gets appalled and angry that I could think that.    Yeah thats exactly how it is with my mom too. Thats why I dont even bother and keep it to a bare minimum. Plus I know any ounce of remorse will be lost by the next day. "
ISTJ,"Tertiary: Introverted thinking (Ti)    Well darn it, I don't know whats wrong with me. There went my excuse."
ESTJ,"now who does that?    Lol....I am punctual, it is freaky...if I say I'm gonna meet someone at a certain time I will be there at least 10-15 mins early...don't matter if I know my friend is habitually late I still gotta be there on time hahaha....it doesn't bother me if someone is late, although I'd give them 15 mins max but if they're later than that then I start to get a bit vexed, can't help it though, and when they arrive I make a joke of it, but don't get mad though"
INFP,It's not because I don't like to learn because I really do.... but everything goes so fast...and I need my time to catch up with the others...but I'm already behind..so behind..    Just take your time ^^ good things come to those who wait... better days will come.
INTP,"Either way, I think it has to do with you getting to know them better rather than them just being around."
INTP,Where the hell are all the Logical dominance INTPs (mypersonality.info)?!

ISTJ,"And yeah, she was interested in me in the before. She did a poor job of hiding it in the beginning."
ISFP,"And yup, I guess I just always over think things.  Thanks so much for your reply - I appreciate your honesty! :))"
ISTP,"The great thing about being an adult is deciding for yourself if you want to go part time, full time, what you want to study, etc."
ISTP,Plus he was too... malleable for my taste any way.    Same. One of my only soft spots is for animals. They're just so precious. And one of the only things that can make me cry is losing a pet.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by brightlywound   I've noticed INTJs tend to precisely pick their words and pay proper attention to having clear sentence structure. However, I do tend to receive very literal answers from INTJs I know irl, even when I'm asking metaphorical or whimsical questions. Am curious about this phenomenon. :) Perhaps the bluntness and sometimes harshness in INTJ communications might partially stem from word choice and their perception of a word's meaning. "
ISTP,"Hahaha indecisive student problems. I feel ya man.    I looked back on what I enjoy doing and what I've been best at all my life, and that's English and writing. I read a lot and sometimes surprise people with how descriptive I am. I've always gotten A's on papers by just writing for a few hours at the very last minute. The thing is, I've never thought it would be worthwhile to invest significant time into it. I'd inquired about it to a counselor when I first got here, but I was dissuaded by the need for STEM majors or something, I guess. They said that English was ""really hard"" here. Whatever."
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by jkp   Do you see life as a game you are winning? Explain why.    I should be winning, I am winning (educationally, socially, work is ok and expected to get better), the problem is being satisfied with what I have and where I place my standards.

ENFJ,"My ISFJ has the most unbelievably high standards with everything and his expectations on those close to him is unreal.  Today he is being a demanding little prick, who upon me not living up to his expectations for that moment packs a said and gets annoyed because I haven't pulled my weight apparently, which is bullshit.  I can never be as hard a worker as him, according to his standards."
ENTP,The Duomo is incredible.  But the ENTP Duomo is way better.
INFJ,"Not impressed, self, not impressed at all. -_-    lol"
ISFP,"Also, I have a strange compulsion to close doors when I'm reading or thinking about something alone. As if the doors magically teleport me to some other world where no one interrupts me or asks me to do things I don't care for. Even if I'm alone in the entire house, sometimes I will spend hours in my little room with my door closed because it makes me feel more secluded and free to think. Anyone else like closed spaces like this? I also like being outdoors, but to think about things I really wonder about and investigate, it has to be secluded and as far away from other people as possible. I do a lot of deep thinking in the car and the shower, too, come to think of it."
INTJ,"What's it like being so sexy? - There are so many things wrong with this question. Firstly, when people meet me, they definitely do not call me sexy. Plus that term is subjective so you cannot just blanketly apply it to a group of people. Assuming you meant, ""what's it like being a part of a personality type that some people find 'sexy'?"" - I'm sure there are people that find ENTPs sexy, people that find ISTJs sexy and so on. It's like asking a black person what it's like to be sexy just because you assume all black people are sexy."
INTP,"It's funny sometimes, but the whole 'communicating with just memes' thing is done way too much. It's starting to get annoying."
INFJ,Classical or Musical scores are really my thing. ^v^
ENTP,"Being exposed to thinkers yes I have tried to turn them down, act really happy and I did but now I fall in this Fi-Si loop and I see new pieces to the story, not that it matters, but my mind replays everything after almost a year and I am overwhelmed to the point of not functioning. "
INTJ,"I have a very distinct memory of kindergarten in which we were all given a striped snake to color in. My teachers eventually became fed up with me because it took me three days to complete it. The memory stands out to me because I can recall being absolutely intent on very carefully and strategically coloring each stripe into a pattern I had in my mind. It wasn't a pattern anyone else recognized as such (no simple red, green, blue, repeat or whatever), but to me it was clear and I remember being very upset when they tried to rush me to finish. "
ENTP,"Originally Posted by Sonny   I'm bouncing off wall, I need to extrovert or I may implode in a destructive way, my friends are being lame and not indulging me by leaving the comfort of their couch and tv. Should I kill my old friends and get new ones?    You should brainwash your old friends into being extroverted and then they'll be new friends. n_n"

Catch, collect my own food, eat, be grateful, be present, be mindful, be kind, be real, be open, be unashamedly myself. Not this Americanized way off what we're supposed to be living ""life""...of schedules, and excess, focus on the wrong things, encouragement to be this way and that it's desirable, to follow, to wake up to work and eat and pay for your shelter. Bleck. I wanna run in the woods and swim in the sea, be in music, laugh insanely, love big and unafraid...things of that sort. Sometimes life feels like I'm a robot, repeating the things I'm programmed to do. We're meant for so much more. I get that strong feeling every evening when everyone but me is in bed and all I wanna do is just go run outside. "
ISFP,I don't care about much of anything right now besides simplifying my life to a manageable level so that I can actually be productive and create.

ENFP,"Originally Posted by StarryHawaii   Has any of you ENFPs tried to trade forex or the stock markets? Are you good at it, or at least see your potential in that area (objectively) if you had decided to keep on trying?    I started to get into that a bit a few years ago, but I was a little afraid to get too involved because I knew I had limited knowledge on how it all worked. I'm confident I could be good at it, so I'm not sure why I don't do it. Maybe because it's kind of boring, and also a tad stressful?"
ENFP,Originally Posted by AyaSullivan   I rather not watch them in 3D if that's possible. I don't really understand the hype of 3D movies.    Me thinks it's something to do with the depth of field. Or it could just be a bandwagon thingy.
ESFJ,"Again, I use the internet for a lot of social stuff. Email, blogging, Facebook..."
ENTP,Anyway I'm highly skeptical of your supply and demand theory.  Non-availability may induce curiosity ... but friendship?   No.  Not for me.  I want my friends to be available.  Not some accursed extrovert.

ISTP,"Sent from my SGH-T999N using Tapatalk    I actually enjoy ISFPs, even if they don't always make sense to me. There's something about the way they handle things that is very attractive, not gonna lie. The unhealthy ones certainly are the ones to avoid, though."

Do you find them to be fascinating and interesting people in their own way but difficult to understand and interact with, or just plain boring nerds? I find myself attracted to ESFPs for some reason, yet I am the complete opposite of one! I'm just wondering how we come across to you. Is being quiet, reserved, shy, rational, not outwardly emotional and ""serious"" attractive/intriguing or do you have the opinion that we should stick to being abstract, lonely and philosophical?    I mostly view NTs as simply being people.  People who have a tendency to be critical or mocking of those they view as unintelligent but for the most part are just as human as anyone else.  Hanging out in large groups of mixed NTs can be a bit awkward due to the conversation topics and humor but that just takes a little getting used to."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Sela   Nowhere did I state that there was anything ""wrong"" with it.  However, the gist of the conversations are examples of why I believe you've mistyped yourself.  Prove me wrong and I will eat my words.    Sorry. Wrong word choice. I should have said 'different'."
ISTP,"oh pick up artist. Well most pick up artists suck at relationships, they might be good at picking up girls at a bar but they have no idea how to maintain dating/relationship past the first few weeks. I'm not giving pick up artist advice I was giving dating/relationship advice on how to act with your phone/facebook/texting inbetween the first few dates seeing as so many guys fuck it up by becoming too needy and smothering.    i wanted to give a counter to the ""be mysterious, don't contact""-thing. i agree that hourly ""what's up?"" texts (in most cases) are annoying. but telling something i just found that might be of interest to the other is something completely different. especially at early stages there's a lot of testing how much of the involved people's thoughts overlap. the more ""i do/feel/think so too!"" there is, the more intense the connection feels. if one doesn't give out anything, there's no way to connect."

INTJ,"Heh.  The ignoring and wiping a person from your life as an act of non-forgiveness (or holding a grudge) then I am guilty of it too.  I don't really feel anything towards these people any more....the only act of ""doing"" is the act of avoidance rather than planning any vengeance.  It's basically because I have reached an understanding that these people will not participate anything towards a ""workable"" relationship.  There is no use for them unless you count usefulness as creating dramas being a pain and creating negativity.  If someone has proven themselves a prick time after time who am I to bang my head up against the wall and beating my breast in hopes that they change?

We interpret the mental processes of the mind behind the page but we need to reflect upon the words to form our own ideas and relations and conclusions, without being trapped in the habit of merely imitating how other people think, so we can have more value in what we experience, rather than only wanting to finish the page or book. If we do that, reading can nourish the mind by giving a person new ideas, insight, more developed connections, different viewpoints, more information, and so on. I think that everyday, we should spend at least one hour staring at the sky and thinking about random stuff in the clouds."

I tried the act during my second year of college, and the fun died by the end of the year. To skip to the end, by trying to please everyone, I went from being my roommate's good buddy to his hated enemy. It may be because of that I will admit to having gained a somewhat sadistic amusement out of watching my roommate's irritation as I unwittingly stole his romantic interest's heart. [Note: That was years ago, she's now taken. :P]"
ISTJ,Hope it goes ok..with your family! Maybe organise a party when you're back with your school friends so you don't feel you've missed out.

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Ham   I didn't want to play hardcore since Burning Crusade.  Hardcore raiding is just too much of a time commitment.  I dabbled in 10 mans in WotLK, but there was only ever 5 of us who were legit, and it's tough to carry 5 other people in 10 main raiding when they're pretty bad."
ESTJ,"We can be bad if we want. At least -I- can. But sacrificing ourselves for the greater good is much more important for us than being a selfish free guy who likes to disobey the rules, disturbing public peace, and belittling others who work hard to support his sorry-ass freedom.    the steriotype "" like showing how great they are"" just been confirmed. yes they work hard - doing unnessesary things. others work hard too, but they dont show off as much as ESTJs. the things ""you do"" listed in a above comment are not just the ones ESTJs its what everyone does,"

ENTP,"Firstly, I don't like the word ""impossible"" unless I'm talking about my friend's chances of getting laid in this century (yes my friend is a metaphor for me).  Secondly, no one knows how wormholes work, if they even exist, etc.  If they do exist, they could feasibly send you ANYWHEN!

INFP,I choose happiness over money... any day. I am a hopeless dreamer and I don't care if they think that is stupid.    I can relate to this so much that it's even scary.
INTJ,"- In class discussions sometimes we'll be sitting there talking about concepts, and I've pick-up the concept, tried to explain it (unsuccessfully) or just something has clicked in my head and it takes another 5-10 minutes for everyone else to figure it out."
ENTP,I assumed that INFJs would have a slightly higher preference due to the fact that they can offer more one on one time than ENFJs due to their extroversion. 
ESTP,"Originally Posted by monemi   Most ESTP tend to get very quiet once we're home without guests. Enough so that we tend to mistype ISTP because we need quiet time too. Don't be too surprised if you see he seems extremely quiet when he doesn't have an audience.    Yeah, he's been through chemo and said it made him more withdrawn, so he's not sure if he'd type as an extrovert or an introvert at this point. I still think he's an extrovert, and does especially Se-dom type things (military, airforce crew chief, builds computers, plays video games extremely well, otherwise seems a lot like my ESTP grandpa.)"
INTP,"Both functions intermix but the preference determines the type. I usually score high with Fi, but never enough to be an INFP, and I do not relate much to the INFP profiles.    I've been thinking this as of late. My Ne has scored higher than my Ti and I wondered for a split second why that didn't make me an ENTP, then I realised that it's because of my introvertedness. Also, it can get me second guessing whether I'm using values or principles. This throws me off because whenever I get my monthly hissy fit over something, it's right as a principle gets ignored, so I associate the emotion expressed with the principle, leading me to question whether it was really a value instead."
ISTP,"- I have an ISTP friend that is a complete loner and really has never had to work on a relationship (in any context... friends, family, you name it) with a person.  Not because issues didn't come up, just because he never needed people enough to bother.  Anyways, he has such a primal, physical, raw vibe to him.  I tease him and tell him he's what a person raised by wolves would act like.  I often wonder if I wasn't a middle child of 4 kids, and didn't always have 2-3 close friends in my life at all time... what I'd be like.  I wish I could experience both... I wonder which I would like more."
ENTP,"I want to start a religion, so I need to address a wide range demographic.    Old people believe things they've heard when they were younger and being fucked while eating chocolate."

No, although I'll give myself some credit and say that I think I could make it for about two months. I don't think people realize how reliant they are on modern conveniences until they're gone"
ENFP,"Originally Posted by ai.tran.75   I recently took Susan Cain introvert test and I actually scored introvert more than most of my introvert friends. . Introvert means you draw your energy internally and work better alone. Extrovert means you draw energy externally and from other people. Enfps tend to fall between both since most enfp enjoy alone time and social events. For example I'm not shy, I can adapt in any social situation , at parties I'm usually the center of attention  - and I'm very friendly , I like public speaking and I love being on stage- however I don't like going out / I have more fun writing or talking to a close friend at a coffee shop, I live in my imagination, I prefer to work alone, and hate team work . Being alone or with a few people makes me happy . It also defer me from being an INFP since I can adapt in social situation . Enfp can be extrovert, ambivert or introverts :) hope that helps"
ISFJ,"The most pertinent life questions are 'What?', 'Where?' and 'When?'"
ENFP,"I realize this is a highly personal perspective, not type limited(maybe love language), but I'm curious how ENFPs tend to view this.    I tell practically everyone that is valued friend of mine that I love them. For me the connection matters more than the words... I have lots of levels of ""I love you."" So words aren't as important as actions. Actions speak louder than words."
ESTP,"Originally Posted by gte   I feel that my ISFJ wife is very pushy and controlling sometimes. It's this tendency to be very outspoken about her disapproval that makes me feel pushed to comply. But after 16 years of marriage, many of them and trying to adapt to unwritten rules, I've become better at recognising when I feel pushed and I just brush off her disapproval.    Thanks for responding.  I think this feels off-putting to us because for J types the judging function is extroverted and for P types the judging function is introverted.  I think, like you, it would be best for me to keep this in mind when I interact with J types and just brush it off as you do with your wife.  But man, it is SO annoying when they're outspoken about this stuff.  I just don't function that way."
ENFP,"If they really wanted to be with me, they would be and wouldn't let geographic distance keep us apart. "

ISTP,is unhappy that my teacher interprets my enjoying of a class as wanting to do more homework than usual.
INTJ,"So I can't answer this question in a single forum post, developping my thoughts on the matter would take a whole book. I'd just say that the most important thing we should change about school is the way it treats children and teenagers like sub-humans who can't/don't want to learn by themselves and take responsibility of their own lives."

I've been lost in thought many times, asking myself why I even bothered to major in science when music was my favourite and best subject in school, or why I'm driving such a piece of shit car most of the time when I have beautiful public transportation to take me to the city and back home.

She is grieving badly right now but even before she was grieving she was a self absorbed, greedy natured and lazy person. This wasn't always the case (I think it's getting worse with age). Once her and I were great friends and she was my confidante. These days whenever I see her she wants something from me. She always talks about herself and never asks me anything about my life, even her best friend had a word with her about her negative talks dragging her down. If she phones me I usually screen the call and avoid phoning her back for a few days unless I feel it is urgent because it is painful to listen to someone talk about themselves for 30-80 mins at a time!  I just plain hate it. My ENFJ brother says that he thinks she will be like this (grieving) for at least another 12-18 months! I don't know if I can cope with any more of it. Even if she got over dad and remarried I don't think that selfish streak would disappear. I must get my giving side from my father I guess, because she is all about what's in it for her. When she comes to stay with me she brings nothing. She allows me to feed her and drinks my wine freely and expects me to wait on her. She sees babysitting my kids on the twice a year basis as a job rather than precious time with her grandkids. It is a very sad existence she lives in."

The whole point of him living at home was to save money, the gas alone would cost about 200$ (with the car his grandfather gave to him) to get where he wants to go and then he would end up having to live off his friends with no means of support while searching for a job, which is basically what he is already doing at home, it's selfish of his step-father to push that on him after saying it's okay to move back.

INTJ,"It's very hard to explain.    Hmm, I'd probably say sometimes I may get a loop feed-back and sometimes not. I think it depends on the information I'm receiving and the patterns I'm picking up. I get stuck in Ni and can't explain it simplistically. Actually and for example, I'll write the Ni part out symbolically, then when I try to explain it, I explain it in more symbols, so in some ways it negates the purpose of what I'm trying to do. I find it kind of odd that I choose to express myself through symbols, abstractions and ""mathematical"" concepts, considering it's not a strong point for me, but the reason I do so and have to, is because it is a quicker and easier way to represent a whole idea, plus it makes sense. I can easily look at a symbol and know what it represents in all it's totality, but trying to explain a concept or an idea with words is a whole other ball game because you become lost in translation, with words. You can always find a symbol to represent 10 explanations (picture says 1,000 words, etc), so in many ways symbols are like the short hand version of an essay, it's the Ni dominants playground. When you have to express yourself ""normally""/Te it becomes a rather tedious and cumbersome endeavor. Part of me hates explaining things because my vision and what I see is very clear, but it's that whole ""getting it out"" process that is hard to do.

I don't believe women can't be abusers, negative people are negative people, regardless of gender. I could think of several occasions when I felt I might have been psyhically abused by one of my exes, so I don't know about society, but I think it's all about the person and how healthy they are. And I totally get the first thing too, when you give a lot and don't receive enough in return, it can be draining, that's why I have some limits to how much I give. I can give alot too in terms of listening to people, being there for them and helping them when they need or just calling them to see how they are. I expect a lot from people too, especially when I have a problem, I expect people to at least care enough to see how I'm doing. In times of trouble you see how many of your friends really are your friends, like I ruptured some ligaments in one of my shoulders, so I'd say this gave me a clear image of how much people love me, like how my parents showed me their support, how my close friends showed me their support and how some not so close friends (more like facebook friends) showed theirs. What works for me in this (and you should try it too) is I don't try to have expectations of people and hey, if they can give back, good, if not, it's still good, I don't really need them in my life, I have a close circle of people (family and friends) who give me the love I need. And of course, I have some limits to how much I give, in order to really go out of my way from someone I must see something in them to make me think they are worth that effort. I'm not saying to close yourself, quite the contrary,, but if you give and you give and they just use you, it will drain you and that's bad because you won't be able to give to those who also deserve it.

You think they are on the same page as you, but they are not, they just talk a good game, they become ""Yes men."" It's kind of like, ""I like to draw, I like to travel, look at my pictures of my recent travels."" ""Wow, that's really cool, I like to travel too."" Yet, they haven't shown any proof that they do this, they start to mimic you and this mimicking makes you think, ""Oh wow, you're on the same page as me!"" When in all actuality they are not, their just an imposter trying to impress for the benefit of themselves. The way I look at it is, you're boring, you don't live life to me, you're too wrapped up in the Protestant work ethic and the bullshit that it entails. Those types of people can fuck off, I want no part of them. All the friends and or people I relate to, do not have this mentality, they are oddities, rare breeds that I enjoy tremendously and that's what makes life special and worth it, for me at least.  "

I actually won't add half the family members to my FB because a good half my updates and posts from the last year have been about controversial topics that I'm fairly certain would put me in not so great terms with half my family and outright ostracized or rejected by another quarter. Those controversial topics include the GLBT community, being openly Not Christian or even agnostic (which is tolerated-ish) and sex *gasp* outside of marriage."

I love animals because they exist without the intellegence of humans in a more basic way. Less is more. My friends don't miss me because i used to be around all the time. My friends that do miss me appreciate me! It's no wonder the one person that treaded on my emotional values was scared when i confronted them about it. Animals, down-and-out people and other empaths see me lonely, as a romantic interest longing. I see I'm lonely now.

ESFJ,"Also, we think more about shaping ourselves around other people and the idea of being a good 'friend' to them, completely forgetting the importance of authenticity in forming long-standing relationships. And this is because we understand people so well. We are able to know things about them very quickly, and then decide quickly how we feel about them. I think the problem isn't  lack of understanding, but a lack of truthfulness. We care more about being pleasant and liked than being actually close to people, which will lead to our general dissatisfaction with our personal relationships. Our understanding of people is usually unspoken, because it's something we've become used to, and sometimes use as a tool for manipulation (bad trait #3). It's also an extremely difficult thing to explain. Usually we're too busy taking action in response to what we sense about a person, rather than pointing it out. "
INFP,"I foresee myself becoming a crazy old cat lady in the future because my interactions with people are so warped and messed up.

I can easily put myself in their shoes and that helps me to understand what the circumstances are and what brought about its occurance."

ESTP,Would you want a radical change where you give up the free healthcare?

ENFP,Hmm I must have read the title wrong I thought we were able to ask absolutely anything. My best friend is ENFP it was a simple question damn you feelers.
ESFP,Just realized she may be an unhealthy type 1.  She seems very preoccupied with how others perceive her and making sure that I know she is not a bad person.  She found out her daughter mentioned to me that she was feeling harassed and criticized by her... and now she is flipping out at her daughter because she is afraid I will think she is a bad person.  I'm not quite sure she sees the line between disapproving of bad behavior and thinking someone is fundamentally bad.  Telling her that I don't see things in black and white like that... that I am smart enough to know there are always two sides to any conflict... and that I don't think she is a bad person... doesn't really have much effect on her.  It's like she wants me to see things in black and white and wants to be absolutely certain that she is in the white category in my eyes...

If I were to tell my mom hw I feel, as an extrovert, she's not a good listener. Last year I saw a psychologist twice, it helped greatly. My mom was the one who suggested it. On top of all this, there's this girl who's been occupying my mind for the past year, a girl who liked me and I messed up my shot. She was the one. You know the one you see yourself growing old with? That was her. Anyways, here I am just letting everything out, unarmed. I hate to be an ass but I don't think it's enough to get advice from people on the internet. I need to go back to a pro.

ISFJ,"Thanks for any and all help!    Of course, ISFJs don't like to be criticized. No one does. Possibly them more than others. But my experience is, that they're hurt especially by being doubted. If your ISFJ says he loves you, don't doubt him. Don't challenge that. They're many other things, but they are honest. He might avoid an answer, if he knows you won't like it, but he won't lie.

It's always been important to me to see the good in others and be there to understand and support them but why does that only leave me with tons of shit in my hands? So I just feel like giving up... no more understanding or supporting. Maybe I'll just turn to be like those people who do exactly what they want and don't give a shit about anything else. Besides that I feel like giving up of all my dreams and hopes. No matter how hard I try I guess I'll never find happiness.     I've recently come to the same conclusion, for the Nth time. I give up too, it seems so useless to give up everything i am just to make others happy when all they want is to use me and throw me away like some toy. This is not entertainment, this is suffering. The only feeling i've gotten from people is numbness, the happiness is a facade and only temporary and not sincere, i do my best to convince myself that people aren't out to get me. When in fact people don't want to ""get me"", keep me, hold on to me for anything. But rather they are out to damage me. I tell myself they aren't, and every time i let someone in, they do it again, every time without fail. I'd love to pick up a life of eremitism, but i think if i was left alone in the woods for a week i'd end up dead one way or another. oh well, at least this stupid shit would be over with.

Sometimes being selfish helps me in establishing boundaries- I tend to want to help people, and sometimes I overreach myself. In that sense, being selfish is beneficial to me. "

INFJ,"I wanted that kind of intimacy most when I was lacking people I was really connected to, had nothing I was too emotionally invested in, and had no one to look up to in my life, but now that I have more of that it just doesn't seem appealing and it doesn't seem like I have time. I have a few close friends, a number of acquaintances, and a few people I admire, and it feels like all I need to have my social and love needs met is more community acceptance, more self-esteem, and a little more quantity. I like what I've been getting much better than what I had, and the idea of recognition from people I admire is far more intoxicating and motivating."
ENFP,Originally Posted by AyaSullivan   It depends on the subject really. I feel like you have very negative image of ENFPs due to something that happened to you.    Not at all. Most of my friends are enfps and I'm kinda obsessed about them :p sometimes they just get on my nerves (which is fine because that's what i do myself) so I come here and write the stuff down
ISFJ,Originally Posted by fishier3000   Alright! It's high time for us to have this thread. Even the ESFJ's are ahead of us! 
ESTJ,"Also, Kathy Reich, author of Bones and creator of Tempe Brennan's character, is also an idealist. A lot of writers are. "
ISFJ,"- Try to 'get to know her' again outside of the context of kids and daily life. Ask her about herself (not about the circumstances surrounding her), be curious about her thoughts on things, why she does whatever she does, etc. Try to learn something new about her every day."
ESTJ,How can you tell the difference between ESTJs and ISTJs?
ENTJ,Examples of my personal experiences of Fi (but with positive outcomes):
ISFP,"Looking for a person to spend your life with and take care of your children with, if you want them, doesn't mean you have to stress over making yourself desirable or focus only on that. And having a partner doesn't mean to chain oneself but to put both strengths together."
ENTJ,So if I'm in a room of kids there is no reason in impressing. I'll sit back and just text my friends the whole time.
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by CorgiGirl   This may sound bad Zeth, but I kind of want your life. The extent of my drama is ""does he like me? No? ok..."" That kind of stuff can last a couple months for me. Not fun. I'm tired of being single.          Originally Posted by Zeth   Huh? Why would you want my life? She's not interested, LOL. My life is summed up as ""Weird yet nice-looking chick keeps staring, not interested, so no responding. Oh wait, my old crush is here, dammit, I don't wanna get back into liking her!""    Lol, someone hasn't been paying attention to the new hit drama, ""The Life of Zeth""..."
ISFJ,"The question is basically: What can I do to help her and give her the most support I can?  Is there a specific thing ISFJ's look for or secretly want/need that I'd be able to fulfill and do for her?  I feel really useless and minimal in actually being able to help her and support her, so please if you have any insight as too what I could maybe do, share away!  "
ENFP,"Can I control my dreams? - no, but I can however wake up and go back to sleep and keep dreaming where I left off. "
INFP,"I like hiking,kayaking,being outside and getting dirty and exploring I like the history channel and the travel channel.. I enjoy philosophy and poetry,Documentaries and the complexities of life and daydreaming. I Love being girly,floral Prints,Pastels and wearing dresses I like getting dressed up and going somewhere."
ENFP,How's your life nowadays?  Stressed? Lack of sleep?  Going through massive changes in your environment? 
ENFP,2. Are you ambitionus when it comes to your career / job?
INTJ,"But continuing as you are... Well, I'm reminded of a quote about insanity by Albert Einstein, if you catch my drift...."
INTJ,"Boggles my mind though, the people who think of me as some borderline asshole, when I think I go out of my way not to cause problems. Just for one week, i would love to act out the inner asshole, just so people would know that I'm actually trying really hard to be nice to their stupid asses."
INFP,"Lawl, I feel fucking terrible right now. Guess I'm not the perfect person I try to be."
ISFP,"For practical advice, I heard that INTJ's have interesting and practical  ideas from ISFP's point of view - at least that's what I heard.  I am  not sure INTJ's here would help, but wouldn't hurt if you try.  Make  sure you detail out your problem.  "
ISTP,"Or else, ""only when the conversation(alist) is boring and not deserving of my attention."" And then just stare at them.    The one word answer and total apathy usually gets me off the hook. Especially when someone is trying to lull me into conversation by making small talk."
INFJ,"But looook, I meant something specific, look at his avatar.."
ISFP,"By circumstances, I meant her pressure point was hit recently, 'cause I doubt me alone would have been enough. Concerning another of my siblings. Couldn't have had this conversation without that, and I'm really proud of what is happening with that sibling... that's our common ground here. Family. <3"
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Happy about Nothing.   Guess what, you aren't THAT nice as you seem to think you are. In fact you can be a real jerk. The end.    Trouble with the roommate? "
INTJ,Originally Posted by rawr_sheila   Okay. How comfortable are you guys with public speaking? Do you like it?    It doesn't bother me as long as I'm reasonably prepared - I'd rather talk about a topic I'm knowledgeable about to several dozens of people than try to small talk just one or two of them.
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Caged Within   ENFPs I know tend to be people that love to laugh and smile. Are any of y'all like that?    Indeed, I love to laugh and smile. I always have a blast with my roommates when are all hanging out in the living room and having a good time.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by SirCanSir   It's the will to fight    She wants blood man. She'll kill a9ain, I swear."
ENFJ,p.s. Why are all of the eyes so ugly??    ME's facial customization has always been lacking. This has always been a big problem with the series though the default faces in essence is way better. 
ISTJ,"But that brings me to a rhetorical question: What is the purpose and intent that drove the creation of the ""Rant"" and ""Mood"" threads? Is everyone who posts in those threads and perhaps even posts at all an attention whore? And you may need to provide more specificity to the word ""feedback"" because anyone who posts on the internet is by definition expecting somewhere between zero to lots of feedback. Even trolls post on internet boards with the intention of harassing, intimidating, and annoying other posters. How is posting in the rant thread about a romantic misadventure going to boost my ego when no one begs for my autograph? "
ISFP,My dad's doing better. He seems pleased with his treatment and I think him being stressed is the worst thing aside from getting results back that say it's worse. So that's good. He's not even in a stage of cancer so I guess I worked myself up a bit. Sigh.
ENTJ,"If after the 3-4 months mark, I still haven't broken up with the guy, it is probably because I have decided that ""I can live with that"" (but still no way near thinking of getting married). I can be dating someone seriously, and know that we will never get married. Although that is probably a one-sided feeling, coming from me. I choose to continue dating him however, when I believe that we have a lot to learn from each other (and he hasn't driven me crazy yet)."
ENTJ,Are you kidding me?  Do you think everyone who disagree with you is a troll?
ISFP,I just wrote that it was 2013 as the date on my paper. 
ENTP,It's an illusion your brain cooks up to overlook every logical flaw that would otherwise convince you this is going to be a terrible decision.
INTP,"Originally Posted by Epherion   ..., that takes peoples souls...    9GAG - Just for Fun!"
ESTJ,"Critical of others. - Only if it's someone who is incompetent in their work, and their incompetence is affecting others not just me."
INTP,"Well, I am from the 1-900 exchange and I'm broke as fuck because of it..."
ISTJ,I actually was discussing the MBTI with my roommate and I told her that NTs can be more conceded than other types on average. But then I had to explain to her that conceitedness isn't completely owned by the NTs.
ESFP,"(about the previous post, NC means 'No Contact', so she's going to not call or text the guy and probably not reply to his contact for some time, if she can do it, cause most people just wish they did it and end up picking up the phone on the second day when He calls...)"
ISTP,"Originally Posted by vt1099ace   We can always go grab a coffee and talk about it eh?....     LOL smooth on quite some levels there, buddy "
ISTJ,"Furthermore, it also irks me when equality threatens choice, freedom of choice.  HSBC is a funny example-the first two initials in their acronym there suggest a reason for that observation someone shared earlier this thread (I do think it's what kicked off this whole mini-discussion/derail).  Why shouldn't any corporation/school/club/private organization be allowed to exercise their preference?  Why is it important to homogenize every last group of people?  I don't get it.  I live in the middle of Little Saigon-there's a reason every liquor store, grocery, and car dealership in the area is staffed by....Mexicans. :)  I value the freedom for people, and groups of people to further their own cause, regardless of how equal anything is.  "
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by furryfury   You don't. If you don't like it don't fund them, but some people obviously feel extremely sorry for this family who had two of their children die, and want to help them.    You guys are not at all engaging me on this topic as I had hoped. Completely bored now too."

ESTJ,"Keirsey and Myers are indeed easier to follow, the system was made to make it more digestable. However, while the functions might be more difficult to understand and study, the resulting insight you get is worth the trouble. Stereotypes are poisonous. You have studied Myers/Keirsey, so you most likely know all about the negative stereotypes assigned to Sensing types, especially SJs. Ns are called open-minded, creative, intelligent, big picture people, while SJs clean the house and do their taxes."
ISTJ,"And yes, I am a believer. And thanks. In fact, if the Big Man in the skies has anything to say to me as He occasionally does on Sundays and throughout the week, He'll speak. I just have to keep my eyes open and ears peeled."

My wink smiley, I thought, showed I was joking--taking it light-heartedly... Sorry. text-only medium is difficult to portray feeling in... I use smileys, but even those aren't always obvious (I don't like wasting time trying to use the little smiley faces that PerC provides--besides, they're kind of ugly IMO)"
ISTP,"Originally Posted by zynthaxx   I prefer ""don't mention it"" to ""you're welcome"". It conveys the message better, imo..    Yeah. I once looked up ""you're welcome"". Apparently it is short for something like, ""oh, no need to thank me. you are welcome to favors from me."""
INTP,"Others can be said more concisely in Latin than in English, such as ""ad hoc"", which most typically is used to mean ""lacking generality or justification"" (""making decisions on an ad hoc basis""), or can mean ""for a specific purpose"" (an ad hoc committee). "

ISFP,So 1) Is it too early to call/ what is the pros/cons of waiting?
ENTJ,"I don't react well to ultimatums or anyone trying to impose control over my life especially if there isn't a logical (Te) reason to justify it. If I was dating a crackhead I could understand their concern. If I'm dating a good person who's being unfairly judged for qualities unrelated to their personality (race, religion, skin color, etc.) and not the content of their character that doesn't fly with me. It goes beyond idealistic concepts of freedom and love, this becomes a matter of personal disrespect and lack of boundaries."

ENFJ,"You have to realise, not all people are meant to be friends and get along...it's just how things are. All you can do is try to be more relaxed about it, most people aren't trolls and they don't have something personal with you. Like INTJs and Ts in general are very direct, they don't use gloves. It doesn't mean they want to hurt you, they just state what they think, you shouldn't take it personal. I have ISTJs and ST/NTs around me and I know how they are, it's easy for a NF that puts too much soul to be offended by them when the NF gets criticised, the thing is most of the times they do it because they want to make you better, they do it with good intentions.

It's extremely annoying! It actually requires discipline for me to do something just for the fun of it. Paying my bills on time, doing a good job at work, being polite to people even when they're really rude, all require almost no discipline on my part. But having fun just for the heck of it? I have to be committed. I have to use reverse psychology tactics. I basically have to hang a carrot in front of my face in the form of imagined payoff. Even then chances are it isn't going to happen. I don't think that's something that most other types could wrap their heads around."

INFP,"The speed of light sat stagnant like a menace in my mind, dragging me to the edge, whispering to my conscience, ""It's a leap of faith."" But all the honor in speculation and words like faith have evaporated leaving behind their afterglow. And that's all it was- an afterglow. In the deceit of time, you stood there, lonesome and gutless (in my mind). And I sought the source, but I was out of control like a paradoxical lucid dream.  Step by step, I was there and I watched every comet burn out. Step by step, I stopped time. And in an instance, a leap of faith symbolized nothing in the blink of an eye. I woke up and burned out. I took a leap of faith (in my mind.) "
ISFJ,"the worst is when i end up seeming like im contradicting myself, because im trying to see both sides, and i support parts of both sides - i cant really focus on just what i think"

However, would any of the ESTJs on here know if it is common for other ESTJs not to be interested in mbti? From what I've read on this website and others, I get the feeling that some of them wouldn't see the point in taking the test, or spending a significant amount of time on it. Is that why I haven't come across another ESTJ yet (that I know of)? Do you guys find that it comes up in conversations a lot with people you know, or would you rather talk about more imporant topics? Just curious :)."

I took the Jung personality test a... while ago now, and as all of you know, it contained many questions pertaining to different social situations. On this online version of the test, my results came up as an ISFJ which has further resulted in me frequenting this forum post specifically. I also took the Myers Briggs test for a college course I'm currently attending (same idea as the Jung test) which contained many questions pertaining to different academic situations. In this version of the test my results came back as an ESTJ. I find it interesting how our personalities can be quite different in regard to our surroundings and the situation at hand."
ESFP,"I like talking about myself the most.  I've found the closer a topic is to the subject of how awesome I am, the better.

I'm working on understanding my own family more, and trying to take in a bit on how to deal with other types, but still... Oh, and I just ""discovered"" Kiersey's book, and I have to say, it's fantastic! I've read his site, and tend to like it, but his book really opens it up for you. His four temperaments theory, while maybe a bit overgeneralizing, really comes together well. I think, though, that there are extremes in all four temperaments that don't fit his standard (or any standard, maybe). For instance, his characterization of SPs doesn't fit well with the ISFP, and his NF portrayal also doesn't fit INFPs. But I think that this is because he tends to stick with what is empirically visible, so the inner workings are beyond him. But he doesn't even go into cognitive functions, discounting them. That is the only area where he's weak, but since he does deal with what is visible, it helps in dealing with other types at a practical level... "

ISTJ,"Well, its not really that hard. Its in fact almost common sense- but one that hardly anyone figures out. The basic reason is that a circular cover can not fall through the hole, no matter what angle you insert it in as. Compare that to a hypothetical square manhole cover- which can go through and be lost forever if someone inserted it diagonally. So yeah, people are just being smart in making sure that the covers don't fall through. "

ISFP,"I prefer the word integrity better. It' about being honest with yourself and honest with others. It's about being true and truthful.

People love to be ""authentic"", but to have integrity can be a burden--there is an accountability there that makes some people uncomfortable. Mean? maybe. ;-)"

There are some people who I just hated right when I met them, and I never had a real reason for it.  I found a lot of good ones, but none of them were the real cause.  It took herculean effort from one of them to go from loathsome to barely tolerable in my mind.

They should appreciate you and understand you for who you are. We all have our own way, our own language, our own distinct personality, just because it's different it doesn't mean it's silly, or whatever and it doesn't mean we should change it. Friends need to love you for who you truly are, not something else and should judge you by the impact you have on them, if it's a negative or a positive one. At least that's how I see things and do things. That's how I manage to have an ISTJ as a best friend and have good relationships with parents that feel like aliens sometimes (ESFJ mom and INTJ dad).

I'm wondering if that's my personal pet peeve or if other ESTPs feel the same way.  I may disapprove of other people's behavior, but I keep those thoughts to myself.  I think J types tend to be more outspoken with their disapproval."
ESFJ,"This ESFJ is such an animal lover, which is really sweet. She's the first to offer people yummy food when they visit and she's got a great sense of humour. She is set in her ways and very status conscious - which is probably what I find bewildering. "
ISFJ,"It's a matter of living the way that feels naturally to me, or being constantly anxious while living the way that this human structured world continues to insist that I do. I can't do the former, the human world of competing perspective, drive, and cognition makes sure of that. I have to learn to function while doing the latter. This just isn't an Si driven world.

ISFJ,you know you are an ISFJ when sitting in the same room as someone who is really stressed but you are unable to help is excruciatingly painful.
ENFJ,"On a particular website which I will inadvertently admit I'm on (OkCupid), there is a question that asks if you are more tactful or more true.  I don't like that question, because I think it's important to be tactfully true."

ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Adrift   So what'd you do with the dog? I almost hit a golden retriever two years ago that was running loose. I stopped but the guy in the pick-up behind me didn't. Fortunately, it was a low-impact collision.    Let it go. I was living with my parents at that time, so there was no way I could've held onto it. I vaguely recall seeing it a few weeks later, so I'm assuming it's fine. Probably just broke free from its owner's home. Playful and somewhat obedient, so someone took the trouble to train it."
ISFP,"Changed cars to an older little car that I like better than that pickup I had, got new license plates, road trip, work, being trusted...

One little goal at a time, that's what inferior Te can safely handle!"
ENFJ,"Is this really an overlap in the descriptions?    I have a very strong feeling that you aren't an ENTJ. I'm very close friends with two male ENTJs....just as the description says, they respect people who can stand up to them, that makes a lot of sense, considering we get along so well. As ENXJs, most of us are naturally talented debaters."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by angelcat   I feel like the absolute worst thing about Si is... you're never dealing with just this problem right now; you're always dealing with the entire interactive history of that person. So if they disappoint you right now, it's not just about this moment's disappointment -- it's about the disappointment you have had with them from the start, and all the times before this that they have let you down."
ENFP,"It really depends on the ENFP, but that's typically where I like to go."
ISFJ,"You know you are an ISFJ when you slightly hesitate thanking other ISFJ's in post, because they might not be able to find where you thanked them. That would make them sad, and you do not want to make them sad."

ISFP,"Sent from my SM-G360V using Tapatalk    I relate so much with this description of se/ni:    Se is used to explore the environment, takes in details, takes in sensory stuff/experiences and starts to store it in the brain, as it goes into the brain, Ni weaves it into an abstract formula which creates patterns and connections, to help build an ISFP's (or any Ni/Se user's) sense of the world/reality. You might find some ISFPs who often try to predict the future and have so much confidence that a certain thing will happen or have answers to questions about things they haven't experienced before. And asking the ISFP ""why"" they know this will happen might make the ISFP lost for words since their Ni map is abstract to begin with, so it is hard to say.It doesn't mean the ISFP will predict correctly or give correct answers, but they will be more readily trying to predict trends about how things will go since their brains are storing things through an Ni map of connections... that create inner formulas to ""make up"" for gaps in experience and knowledge. In fact, when an ISFP predicts wrongly, they might feel super frazzled by it because then they have to go back in their heads and subconsciously ""adjust"" their Ni formulas and their map can become distorted in the process. Since you know that if one formula is wrong, then other answers used for that formula will be affected. Which is why some Ni/Se users can have really twisted versions of reality and stick by it so faithfully, since that is truly what their inner Ni maps have become like as a result of incorrect formulas or adjustments taken too far (or no adjustments taken at all).

INFP,"Ughh, I don't know. I mean, I relate to the definitions of INFPs, but I feel I don't relate to other people who are INFP. Does anyone else feel this way?    As Ironic as this is going to seem, I totally relate to this. I can't relate to a lot of stuff others talk about here. I'm not as dramatic with my emotions, at times I'm rather void of them, and I'm no where near as compassionate and paternal as the majority of you seem to be."
ISFP,"At least, that's how I pictured it how it had to go, but then she burst out in tears, which was the leading cause for a better talk.   "
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by zeth006   But one post really disturbed me, then left me morally shaken inside.

Are you sure you aren't 7 years old?  Doesn't seem like a big deal to me."
INFP,".... But in some ways, the most significant choices one makes in life are done for reasons that are not all that dramatic, not earth-shaking at all; often enough, the choices we make are, for better or for worse, made by default."
INFJ,"What's that say about us? We want to believe we are hated, and not loved, is that it?    I think it has more to do with the majority of people not being able to validate themselves, for whatever reason, therefore they need for some validation from others and if it's not said often, they start to feel they're unworthy again.  It is really not something I understand, to be honest.  I don't need others to validate me... so, if someone says they love me, I take them at their word until or unless they manage to prove otherwise.  I don't need someone to say it all the damned time and would really prefer that they didn't as, to me, if you keep telling me stuff like that I begin to wonder whether you're trying to convince me or yourself.  "
INFP,I'm sick of feeling like I have to be someone I'm not. Damn the world favoring extroverts!
INTJ,"I'm often surprised at how many people react with such rage to your posts and of course my own posts. The responses usually are really talking about themselves....like they have some kind of blood fued happening and they simply must avenge for the sake of their honour.  I don't get it.  I can see there are a lot of NFs who don't do this and can see how unhealthy it is, yet the people who do this are widely supported.  Why, for crying out loud, why?    "
INFP,I will admit i'm REALLY conservative to even admit that
ISTP,"no surprise the ""guys with breasts"" are more appealing. as soon as you're interested in anything but farmville, housekeeping-stuff, fashion, and finding mr. perfect, you're not fitting the female stereotype. that's a pretty short list of interests, if i may say so."

There is no ultimate purpose to everything, it's absurd and illogical to think there would be, that's like asking ""what is the size of everything?"""

It didn't even cross my mind when I ran down my mental ""to-do"" list. Chief among what I wanted most beside what I actually posted was to patch things up with my father before his Alzheimer's gets bad, stop being so anxious around people offline, prove to myself that I'm capable of doing what I'm afraid I'm not, and find a comfortable, reasonably well-paying job."

It's definitely about the name-brand recognition. Everyone in my area (so San Joaquin Valley in CA) is always ""OMG"" about Ikea... especially my mom (Lol). I think it's just all about the ""warehouse"" idea of shopping... Costco is a really big thing around here too. It's also a big deal because the closest Ikea is in LA... so I always hear about student/family trips with big trucks and they go to Ikea and buy furniture. "

He can't stand anything emotionally real or remotely negative, nothing ever gets resolved, and the end result is he gets his way. My only choice being to give in, be criticized, or leave forever (which is pros bly what I should do). If I have no voice, and he has no ears, how can it be any other...? It's the perfect ""excuse"".

They'll always find that one word that you said that could be taken a different way. That was hard sometimes because I honestly didn't even remember what I said because it was more about the feelings behind the words than the actual dictionary definition. So then he felt like I was being evasive and changing my ""story"" when I would say I didn't remember saying those words or something like that. I wanted him to get the emotions and he wanted to get the words and we just talked right past each other into a world of hurt. "

ISFP,"And then you do that. You turn around and walk away. I'd recommend not even giving her time to respond. Just walk away. If she chases you you've got a good chance. If she doesn't she might track you down later and then you've got a good chance. If she doesn't bring it up again then after a week or two you can be pretty sure you've done everything you can and aren't going to get her back. In the mean time be her friend, let her be as independent as she wants, don't put any pressure on her to be anything or to go any way. And start the process of moving on as I described above."
ENTP,"Here is a question: What's the best way to learn how to fly?    Well, before you learn how to fly, you must first see if you are capable of it. Thus, off the cliff face you go."
ESFJ,Since I've started I'll go first... bit of a pathetic one this I admit to start with:

ESFP,"Originally Posted by Fat Bozo   Yeah, he's not ESFP.    Thanks for the wonderful sarcasm Bozo."
ESFP,"I'm pretty sure they avoid being treated like crap. There are plenty of other people who won't treat her badly so why would she be friends with you at this point?    I don't have many friends because there aren't many people I like talking with. There is the shitty past, you're right, however it did end amicably, no issues or problems in the aftermath, so I'm mainly wondering why this is such a big issue."
ISFP,"The bitch woman even called me 'fake' at one point because I locked her in her own arguments, which, coming from an ISFP, may be considered a very gross insult."
ENTJ,"Our last game session had ended and I was running out of time. Fortunately, I have a very quick brain. It just happened to be Black Friday, when we all get together for Thanksgiving ."
ENFJ,It's a very surreal experience lying on a bed in a room with four christians singing hymns as you think about how eventually one day you're going to wind up killing yourself.

INTJ,"Nobody ever tells you that there doesn't need to be a grease *fire* to make adding water a really bad idea, you just need hot grease. Interestingly enough, Mythbusters had just done an episode on this the week before, but I had yet to watch it off the DVR."

(Not local at the moment, but close enough.)  "
ENFP,"Okay, a bunch here. (We INTJs are absolutely hopeless when it comes to feelings and relationships so we need help. x'3)"

ENTJ,"I don't have judgments or values unless people are being hurt or could be by an action (an easy example of this would be cheating....

INTJ,"Originally Posted by lolthevoidlol  I've been wondering how Ni fits into empathy. As a perceiving function  that can take in and make a lot of connections, I feel like in my life  it has been a great boon to understanding people and putting myself in  their shoes- as they walk in their shoes, not as I would walk in their shoes. Does anyone else see a relationship here?    This...is something I have been thinking about quite often as well. No ""scientific"" conclusions, but I do think that, on a very general level, it should be possible for a ""mastermind"" to understand the essences of the cognitive functions well enough to emulate the experiences of other types. In short, I've been trying to transfer knowledge of typology into simulation to try and create a brand of empathy that begins with understanding. Hasn't worked particularly well yet. I am aware of the pitfall: walking in another's shoes as they do. But there is, I believe, a greater reality of individuals that remains inaccessible to anyone else. Appreciating this, actually, might be the beginning of empathy."

I have very bad memories from that time, and have tried so many times since then to somehow make up for it--but one can't... sigh...    You know - I'm really fed up that I understand him better than he understands his own self. Ok, it makes sense to me to try and find out when he doesn't want to talk.

INFP,I can really relate to this a lot.I've always tried to somehow make myself better wheather it's to have more confidence to treat others better or to try and improve aspects of the world.
ENTJ,"My partner knows all this, but he feels that it is fundamentally wrong to vocalise his appreciation in this way (too close to disrespectful behaviour in his opinion).  I respect him for his decision and admire him for sticking to his principles as he makes no demands on me to conform to his standard. In fact, he seems quite amused by my cheers and whoops. He says this is because it is so far removed from my usual behaviour."
ISFP,"My oldest sister lives away with her husband and baby... I never really felt quite as close to her anyway, in hindsight. My brother is always gone, blogging or running around, doing whatever he likes, or working; kid sister is not on his agenda, nor should she be. My other sister, with whom I have oft practically been joined at the hip, is making plans for school and work and even romance and moving and everything I am happy for her to have; she and I could use the space though honestly, things change, even a strong love of sisters. Two of my only friends, two sisters who in some ways although not close are significant to me, are moving away to live their high-profile, private life elsewhere, wherever that may be; my other friend got back from a three-week cruise and has a busy life and got a surprise birthday party, she's a ball of energy ESFP, lives a very full life, and I will now be expected to be her bosom companion all summer all of a sudden after the other girls and my sister move away. I will try to have a good attitude about it, make the most of every moment, but I can't imagine I'm exciting enough for her. Seeing her disappointment won't help my confidence that's for sure. Mostly depressing is simply the fact that I have never been as close as one might be to any of them. People I've known for 6+ years, and they're just shadows still in so many ways. And God knows what it is I appear as to any of them. I'm such a little fool. Haha :D"
ISFP,"With that question asked, I hope you don't mind a follow up: what things do you enjoy discussing most?    Questions of people and humanity in general, perhaps. I observe things about people and I think about the human nature a lot, so that might be it. But really... it's not that definite."
INFP,"Then I fell into something with an INTJ. Simultaneously she was strong-willed and desiring of me to dominate her. She was so intense and so fast-paced that I was a little scared of her. I forgot to breathe with her. I liked her so much. I did her a great disservice by going out with her and agreeing to be in a ""relationship"" so soon. I just didn't know what to do. My head was spinning and I was trying to get Ego back, and here she was."

INFJ,There is a steady proportion of people who work/volunteer for do-gooding causes who are really in it just to prop up their ego. They are somehow completely blind to concepts like truly working and following something through for the sake of a) doing a good job and b) actually addressing the purpose and logic underpinning the work they signed up to do. At the same time they seem blind to their own incompetence and to the shallowness driving their involvement in these causes.

ISFP,"If an INFJ wants to have a relationship with an ISFP, they will have to sacrifice so much of what they hold near and dear about themselves, that they may feel violated over time, and taken advantage of--like they are giving so much, and the other is just taking, without really giving back. I really don't see any solution... Keirsey talks about avoiding Pygmalion Projects, where you try to mold the other person in your image, but some people are naturals at that, the INFJ being towards the top of the list, if not at the very top. That means that the one thing that most gives them value is the one _last_ thing that the ISFP needs, or is the one thing the ISFP needs not to be done. "
ENFJ,You are the worst person for me. You bring out a side of me which should never see the light of day.
ISFP,"You were asking what are we doing on weekend, well I am sorry I could answer for ""we"" right away. Its not that I have not thought about that (Truthfully no). If you have asked me what I am doing that would be easy. Hmm how about I will bring flowers for you first then we will go for a movie, then we can have lunch.  Then to the Planetarium (so that I can hold your hands). "
ENFJ,And I only have a vague idea of what kind of posts I've been making tonight. I've just been posting randomly. 
ENFP,"I will help you out - I'm placing you on the ignore list.  You are too arrogant to accept that your views are incorrect, so I refuse to accept any views from you.  You are trying to teach, instead of trying to learn.  Shame on you.  You are a fool who lacks maturity and wisdom, and neglects the opportunities to increase your knowledge."

Then I have to get up at 7 for five hours of focus-requiring chemistry and then a lecture. I run on 9-10 hours of sleep. I'm gonna die.    I actually do recommend 5 hour energy.    That saved me last week.

People I don't like, I don't give a fuck what my standing is with them. I don't mind if I look foolish in front of people if it's for a good cause. But there has to be a good reason.    I see. My friend was very particular with who he associated himself with. Most of the time they had to be apart of a popular crowd or hold standing and interest. He was very much concerned with grouping up with a crew or getting with girls. Before I befriended him I had a disdain for him because of it. It was quite amusing because to me he felt like my reverse image. It was not until we discovered we had shared interests that things started hitting off. He had this tendency to show the geeky side he had to some but then not reveal it to others for the sake of preserving some image. He wanted to be, cool. I feel he may of been an Enneagram 3. Unsure if that is common for ESTPs or not. If he is one that is.      Originally Posted by monemi   2. Criticize my clothes or work, I'll get over it.

I could reinvent myself at each new school I went to. By my later teens, I was very good at fitting in when I wanted to. I enjoyed trying different crowds and differently levels of popularity. I tended to use people because people outside of my family had been so disposable. I made new friends easily and then moved so much.

ESTP,"Originally Posted by Origami767676   I need help identifying my friends type.You see, I had her take the test and she got ESTP. It fits her description just fine I think. The trait that I think might be different it that she is quite emotional. Are ENFPs ""cold"" on the inside? Thanks.    If she's emotional than probably not ESTP, I'll share happiness or feel bad for someone if they're crying, but not like an ENFP does. ENFP's like to help people and are very expressive of their emotions, so they can be cold if someone treats them coldy. If someone was truly cold though, I'm sure they wouldn't go out of their way to help others."

ISFJ,"As far as experiencing it, I think it will come with time and remaining hopeful. We don't know what tomorrow will bring, but looking back at my past and where I am now- I've learned so much and come so far; it's good. I know that's what I can look forward to."
ISTJ,"In the mean time...I'm being reminded that some problems take longer than others to go away. My former crush (""FC"") reluctantly says hi to me when we're passing by or meeting up for club functions. I've been lately reflecting on our old friendship and realizing that though we only hung out for two months, we had a unique effect upon each other. Before I ditched her group, she indirectly encouraged me to loosen up and to freely crack light jokes, something I've been doing more lately with my friends. I through my natural ISTJ tendencies showed her what it's like to focus my energies on something I want."
ESFP,"So, any ESFPs wanna share what they like? Prince? Michael Jackson? Creedance Clearwater?"

ESFJ,"Originally Posted by Hunny Bunny   I did read your post thoroughly, and your response proves my point with you saying ""THEY"" - you are generalizing.  THEY = all ESFJs.  Any type can be ""dangerous"" - not just ESFJs and it's very shallow and offensive for you to come on the ESFJ forums and bash like this.  Please stop.    see my PS :)  BTW, how do you like how MBTI generalize their conclusions about ESFJ--using ""they"" as in ""They're usually quite popular and good with people, and good at manipulating them. Unlike their ENFJ cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them understand the real consequences of their actions."""
ISFJ,"Hard to keep up with their level of energy sometimes though, haha    Sounds like the two of you are a good match.  Currently I don't have much energy, so that's not a problem."

Talking about marriage and houses and leaves me 2 days later saying he didn't know if he could ever love me enough to marry me, ever love me as much as he knew I loved him."
ISFJ,"- If this crush of yours would be gone for some months (work, travel, etc) would you check everyday his/hers status and posts to see how things were with him/her?"
INTP,I was thinking that maybe all the black holes within this universe eventually consumes everything within this universe and everything that is consumed goes to the same place and is molded into one tiny condensed object and once everything is consumed all the blacks holes will close simultaneously and the second they close another big bang occurs via the condensed object the black holes created and this repeats forever.
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by maust   All implies ""any"". A better question would be ""Do you enjoy gender roles?"" To which I get to respond, ""What on earth are you talking about? Gender roles exist. I don't particularly enjoy getting harassed on the street, nor do I enjoy having to walk everywhere with others so I don't get raped. I identify as a woman though, so I'm lucky enough to have been born into a body I accept. But I have no idea how one can ""enjoy"" a gender role, unless you're talking about kinky shit.""

ENFP,"I know how difficult nursing school is and how strenuous being a nurse is (there are lots of nurses and doctors in my family and they have lots of ""horror stories""), but I'm more worried about successfully handling all the requirements and courses. I did well in science in high school and really enjoyed it and I'm not squeamish or freaked out easily, but I'm terrified of doing a science-y program since I've been out of practice for a while. I was thinking of doing an RPN degree first, then hopefully become an RN after that (all in all, 6 years of nursing school, at least three with work placement). I know I have the ability to do it and I'm definitely working towards the end result, but I'm just kind of terrified that I'll cave in under the work and give up. My (theoretical) first year courses consist of subjects like Anatomy/Physiology and Microbiology/Immunology. For any ENFPs in the medical field, how have you found coping with whatever pre-med/nursing course you took, handling stress and routine, or other things that you think an ENFP would initially struggle with?

Not sure if it's going to be B&W or colour. If I do go colour, the two ODST helmets will be Red and Blue in a two fold reference: RvB and Mega/Protoman. If I do throw in the BSG reference, Imma remove the Nineball and invert the d20 (so the triangle is point side up) and throw the dots on the d20 triangle and shrink the ^ down so that the inside is flush against the tail of the Swordfish...

One has to pretty much threaten me physically, though there have been rare (two) exceptions in my life.  One involved lack of integrity coupled with deceit that could have put me in danger, the other was a person who tried to kill themselves and then got pissed off at me when they found themselves alive in the hospital the next day because I intervened.  My response was ""If you want to get out of your hole, I'll do anything to help you; but if you want to dig yourself deeper into your own hole, then you're on your own.""  In both cases, I calmly, firmly, and briefly told the person that I was angry, EXACTLY why I was angry, and then I was simply DONE with them.  Forever.  It takes so much to get me angry, that once I'm angry, that's it -there's no reason to interact with that person ever again.  I forgive quickly, but never give the person another chance to repeat their mistake with me.  :/  "

INTJ,"For the rest of you though, there is one book I rather enjoyed, ""Star Trek: I'm Working on That"" by William Shatner. It's actually a very interesting book that explains relevant research into bringing the fictional technology into reality, which seems rather INTJish. It's got some good humor and its topics has a real basis in science.    I wouldn't actually recommend any ""math/science"" books over everything else, there are some good ones out there though.  I like Malcolm Gladwell, but it's probally not ""sciency"" enough to satisfy your query."

ENFP,"Originally Posted by ai.tran.75   I think INFP and enfp have a lot in common. I'm an enfp but I don't really care for parties and I prefer reading a good book and I go to movies and art museum alone however - we differ in the fact that you can throw me at a party, in a public speaking class or in a room full of strangers and I'll still feel comfortable and I notice INFP enjoys listening over talking as enfp do both simultaneously. I am borderline INFP though (only 6% extra version over introversion) so perhaps those characters are in between :) "
ISFP,"So in this particular case, I realized today that Walmart sells combat boots from the 'Faded Glory' brand for roughly $20 and that made me smile, as I live in combat boots pretty much all year round. I have a pair I really don't care about that I wear for my job in a grocery store and they're pretty sturdy (they were more like $70.) But unfortunately I've scuffed those up something fierce. When I want to look a little more presentable -- like when I'm going to a more upscale than usual show or trying to turn on my FWB when we're out with the group in prep for a romp -- I figure I can pair the lower quality Walmart ones with a cute (and sometimes revealing..I'll call it cute-vealing) outfit. Even though they're lower quality, they're really pretty."
ESFJ,-someone treats me badly i want to treat them back badly too. but then i feel very guilty and feel bad for them. 
ESTJ,"Originally Posted by Pinina   So, most other forums has one like this, but I couldn't find one here. "
INTP,Originally Posted by Ablysmal   You get grounded for having conversations about physics and Bach? What type of tomfoolery is this?!    
ESTP,"Thoughts?    How close are the percentages in her T and F?  That could be your answer or her enneagram could affect it.  If she is still young she may be having issues sorting through or expressing her feelings.  Frustration of not understanding them could be tipping the scales on her tests.  I think most ESTPs are mistaken for having ADHD when in fact, they do not."
ESTJ,"I admire your effort to understand MBTI, because for ESTJ does not have a natural propensity to understand these theoretical systems!"
ESFP,"Originally Posted by drummaster350   First off I want to say that I love ESFPs.  They know to show love and how to receive love.  Their childlike wonder is very attractive,occasionally aggravating, but mostly cute.  My question is this: how come you lovely ladies cannot take even the most carefully worded, objective, loving, constructive criticism?  I've calmly tried to explain to my ESFP lady friend how I felt about some of the things that she was doing that were harmful to me, our work crew, and herself.  It was like I'd stabbed her, she looked so wounded, which was then followed by unspoken anger.  I could tell she was upset with herself, upset with me, and I felt terrible but she knows that I love her.  I wouldn't have taken the time to confront her if I didn't care.  Could you ESFP's please explain why you take criticism so personally?  (By the way you guys look really cute when you're angry .)    Well, I can only speak for myself here; but if I do get criticized, deep down I know the person giving the criticism cares. I just like to feel competent, in control and helpful. Being criticized bruises my ego right quick because that completely destroys me envisioning I'm accomplishing being those things that I want to be (in control, helpful and competent). "
ENTP,"Originally Posted by emmanuel13   Delusions are your answer, INFP's have delusions    Yes, but that doesn't explain why we are hotter and sexier than you. That would only explain why we would think so if we weren't. But that's ok, I did ask for your opinions and I didn't ask specifically for you to put some thought into them."
ENTJ,"So, cool head under pressure.  And yes, I would say that I'm content.  A lot of that is confidence that I can handle anything that gets thrown at me.  Bring it.    This creates more questions. An INTJ has similar skill as these: problem solving, forward thinking, detached/logical thingking, etc, yet they are more prone to depression, anxiety, and general moodiness. Why is this? Is it simply because they use Fi as their tertiary function, rather than last like an ENTJ, or are there other things at play?"
INTJ,"Like the ""Every time I see your avatar I pause and stare at it playing no fewer than three dozen times trying to decide if kitty ever puts his front paws on the ground"" thanks.

ENFJ,And asked me to upload it on facebook - which I did. 
ENFJ,"However, she claims that she doesn't think of herself as pretty or attractive in the slightest. When we hung out over the weekend, she was like ""You're going to make me look bad, because you look so good""......bleh.....guys don't follow me around the room. It almost feels as though I'm carrying the weight of her poor self-esteem on my shoulders."
INTP,2. The robot finds out about Chaos first. He will be chaotic until he finds Justice. Then he will be righteous until I will press Restart button.
ENTJ,9. Do you want to try another career or study more in future? why?
ISFJ,"Haha sorry if the clip wasn't all that exciting, it was the best physical representation I could find. I couldn't find the words and I was too lazy."
ISFJ,"-you realize that you're the one who's shouting out all the answers during a group competition and you fear that your group mates might get annoyed so you stop answering, but after a while, you get back to how you were."
INFP,"All o f this whining and yearning for this existential ""X"" that lurks somewhere so elusive you can't even begin to search for it. I understand, and to a certain extent empathize with this sense of yearning, but i doubt many of you can't make the case of fulfillment whilst in this state."
ENFP,"and you're right... It can be pretty melancholy, no pun intended. maybe the smashing pumpkins was a bad example. I had the tune ""Perfect"" in my head, which is one of their more upbeat tunes."
INTP,"There are a whole lot more ""normal"" people with ALS than there are physicists with it...at least he has something to occupy his mind with. He seems like a champion to me."
INFP,I hope I wasn't the one who ruined the INFP forum...
INFP,So in exactly 29 days I will be 20. I can't help but feel contradicted between the fact that it means I have spent 20 years without ever evening holding hands with girl or really ever getting to know a member of the fairer sex. It weighs a lot on me and leaves me empty. Then again I feel I'm just wanting to throw a pity party and I should really just repress this and move on and be happy no matter what. 
ESFP,Originally Posted by Powerhouse   Are ESFPs the most emotionally compatible type with INTJs?    My friends I like is one im close to her. The funny thing is that we both didnt remember eachothers name the whole school year. Shes such a nice physcolgist like person that shes fun to talk to because she will listen to me and respond knowlagble. I also am one of the only ones that know how she gets annoyed. I have almost never confused her reactions unless we talk along for along time. She understands me well to. I once made a game of giving people cookes for who listened to what I said at a later date and she got so many compared to the others.
ISFP,"A confession. I believe that I will never achieve anything, and that scares me."
ENFP,"Originally Posted by Aya the Whaler   Pretty much, yes.    Can we hang out? :3"
ISFJ,@Cassieopeia  I took the enneagram test and I got 9w1 7w6 3w2. Do you think it's perhaps because I'm a Type 9 that I maybe seem like an ISFJ? o.o
INTP,I was re-watching the 6th season of Lost recently and trying to type the characters--and then realized that fictional characters are impossible to type.
ISTP,"Have you ever had someone tell you, you've got to meet my friend X, you're exactly alike!And then you meet X and you're like WTF, yeah we're exactly alike if I suddenly became an extrovert, changed my sense of humor, and lost about 100 IQ points...."
INTP,The nail that stands out is the one that gets hammered down.
INTP,I cant apply eyeliner to my right eyelid because my left eye refuses to focus. This irritates the crap out of me.

ESFJ,"And what is a fellow ISTP doing during this monologue - apart from thinking ""Who the hell cares? The guy's not here. Dot."" - ? I was redesigning in my mind the I'm-with-stupid t-shirt into a I'm-with-ESFJ one :D"
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by timely.grace   *sigh* I fear the realization that he isn't the one for me. I fear a lot, to be honest. It's really lame. "
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Rhee   Sweet! How long will it go on? Up until Halloween?    Yup, pretty much."
ISTP,"Originally Posted by DemonAbyss10   Hashtags... oh how they need to disappear from the earth along with twitter who started a pointless trend. Hashtags make me want to kill people by the millions, or destroy the earth itself. They totally ruin my ability to read and follow along in discussion."
ESTJ,"Socionics, on the other hand, says talk to a Ne dom/aux. In theory, they'll rub off on you."
ISFJ,"I debriefed with my INFP colleague and friend who works with him. He told me the guy tends to become mean as self-defense mechanism. So I take it as ""well, I feel ridiculous, maybe it won't be as bad if someone else feels ridiculous too"". But it was a bad tactic because nice guys like my colleague immediately sided with the victims and he lost all potential support from his own ranks. Less sensitive people in the room just felt the whole farce was funny, but that didn't help either because I highly doubt it was supposed to be a farce at all. Though I don't really know what it was.    Weird - what's his behaviour and actions been like since the event? Does he seem embarrassed/ashamed/remorseful? "
ISFJ,"Yes.  Exactly!  To me, if she doesn't want me, then it's pointless.  It does feel like rejection."
ISFJ,Originally Posted by TexanIFJ   I'm still trying to reassure myself of a correct typing so I have a question for established ISFJs...

ISFP,"Originally Posted by goodthankyou   I have a theory that it's to do with your less conscious functions. You don't trust them, and you resent it when you see them in others.    Dunno!

Mashed potatoes, milkshakes, pudding, ice cream, pumpkin pie, it's all going to be messy anyways. You can't go wrong by giving me something good to eat that requires less chewing than other foods."
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by marzipan01   Sexual 6's are said to be often 6w7's so let's just assume that we're speaking of 6w7 sx. People of this enneagram type are said to be both masculine and feminine. The men want to be the epitome of masculine and thus can often be mistaken for type 8's. I think this is all highly interesting because one of the reasons I was doubting the 638/648 tritype is because it seems to me to be an overtly masculine tritype. And yet when I'm being honest with myself I can easily recognize a high identification with my own animus. I must be strong, I must be forceful, I must push, fight, and be brave. I feel this pull in my psyche to push because if I don't, no one will stand up for me and no one will stand up for themselves."
INTJ,"*Pierces glared computer screen with darts and happy faced balloons.  Wraps pierced, glaring gift, and broods that the post office is closed preventing me from delivering this gift.*"
INFJ,"LOL :-p but I guess I don't mind if you're bad at it, too"
ENFJ,"The past I used to get involved and that would escalate the situation. Now, that I don't get involved, I feel horrible for the other person I couldn't protect. It seems to be a never-ending cycle. Perhaps I'm too sensitive, but I don't know -- I think anyone would get upset when they see their own sister getting yelled at by her husband. I wish I wasn't here - but leaving this situation isn't the answer, even though I can pack up any day and get my own place. "
ENTP,"Originally Posted by TwitchdelaBRAT   So, since you have been kicked at by the pony and bit, HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW?!?!"
INFJ,"@Ava82  I get this kind of anxiety all.the.time. If you get those kinds of thoughts on a regular basis, there's a book called The Untethered Soul that has really helped me when I remember to put it into practice."
INTP,"And I will also really miss not understanding most of the language. I love walking around in the city w/o being able to understand what the people around me are saying. It lets me feel a bit more peaceful. But when I want to communicate, it's quite fun to try to make that work."
INTJ,"You are talking about a time frame of 22~37 years of age. That particular 15-year time frame, although it is about 15~25% of human life expectancy, can outmatch the 30-year duration afterward. If one is highly intelligent as most INTJs are, one can use that time [to change the acceleration/velocity of obtaining money] rather than [to obtain more money]."
INFP,I was just thinking about connections and how they're bound to happen.
ISFJ,"It's all just a way to control thoughts of people so as to 1) keep them from begging me for answers and 2) make sure everything is running smoothly. It's all done as a way to adapt to teamwork, because I am highly functional as an individual."
INTJ,"I've heard of INTJs doing that, but never actually from an INTJ (except jokes), just other types claiming that it happens. It may be possible - I just never ran into it."
ENFJ,"Also, my mother is doing a lot better now that she is taking antidepressants. That is good."
INTP,My inferior Fe is really rearing its ugly head every chance it gets lately. I wish I knew why so I could fix it. Having kneejerk emotional reactions to something as simple as a comment by someone I don't even know is really inconvenient.

If you want her in your life show her you're interested and interesting. Try to be available at spontaneous times. Don't smother her, nor guilt her for what may seem liked delayed appreciation.

ENTJ,@extrovertedhermit  I think given your condition typing you may be harder as the questions may not account for your social perception. Finding the right person to administer your MBTI test will be important as otherwise I suspect you will get misleading results.
ENFJ,"Another thing is my appearance, I have no clue what to do about it. I hate my face but I'd never get plastic surgery, and it's really frustrating. If I tried to talk to a friend about insecurities like this, they'd think I was being attention-seeking or something, or else they might worry about me. Therefore I'll make them think I have no insecurities. But how exactly can I not with a face like this? Plus everyone around me is so thin and tall. I just don't know what to do, if anything. "
ESTP,"Seriously depends what kind of Estp you are writing about tho even as a trope or cliche.

ENTJ,"Originally Posted by enfpeeved   Hello everyone! Do you guys feel like you engage in any sort of emotionally suppressive or avoidant behavior, and if so, could you please describe it? I'm talking about a long term coping mechanism, rather than a method you use to avoid displaying emotions when it's not appropriate. An example of an emotionally suppressive behavior is making a joke out of everything, so that you can't take anything too seriously, and an example of an emotionally avoidant behavior is habitually ending relationships even though there's nothing really wrong, because you don't want to become attached.    I've been reading over these questions and the replies and thinking about them.  Furryfury answered about sometimes feeling very emotional about things but putting it in check because sadness and anger aren't productive.  I can relate to that, and the times in life where there is a bombardment of circumstances at once is when I get in trouble.  For example, a time where there was a death of a loved one while simultaneously a relationship thought promising fell apart, the car engine blew, and a dept. at work got outsourced all at once.  My usual ""suck it up, cupcake"" fails me then.  I can sometimes vent it with the support of my ""F"" friends, but there is a danger of them pulling me into wallowing in it, too, as they so enjoy a good pity party.  I find physical labor (gardening, clearing fence rows, etc.) my best friend when I'm overloaded emotionally or mentally because they are very ""here and now.""  Wallowing is a luxury I can not afford.  "
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Scoobyscoob   Okay, I think I get it now. If the connotations are the problem, then the meaning should be changed. Instead of saying asking out to dinner to talk some more, it should be asked more like grab a bite to eat and chat some more.

But then it was a cheapo laptop so then 5 months later I got a Mac and I had to learn all the touch gestures and everything which was a pain in teh butt.

ENFP,"Originally Posted by Reticent Charm   I have two guy friends that are ENFP, they both are very much like you,   "
ENFP,"I guess it depends if someone is trying to teach you, or if someone is actually enjoying exploring options/conversation with you. I guess younger/immature INTJs sometimes get into that mode of trying to ""help"" people by telling them how things are. It is especially hard for INTJs to allow ideas to be left unsettled or to be constantly expanding searches for other explanations, the Ni wants to bring everything into a unified explanation of some sort.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by goodthankyou   Yes I've heard that it is ideal, too. But lately there's been so many Fe vs Fi posts bitching on each other I'm thinking that something doesn't add up.    I have an ENFJ daughter. We can have a ""volatile"" relationship, but she is good at seeing through any of those Fe-Fi gotchas, and is even good at getting me out of my shell. She is currently dating a guy she thinks is an ISFP. If there is _any_ Fe type that can handle and deal with our Fi, it would be the ENFJ. No other FJ type seems to be able to understand or know how to deal with our Fi, but my ENFJ daughter can--she grew up with me, so maybe that changes things, but my hunch is that if any Fe type can, ENFJ would be it."
ISTP,"People? People need shit like affirmations, gestures, gifts, etc. They need to be told how you feel. Their emotions need to be considered around every corner.

I actually have gone back and inquired of my friends if I did such behaviors, and that is the only way I found out I was doing them. They told me they understood that I didn't mean to be hurtful, and that I was just being honest. I'm glad that they understand my intentions, but yeah, a person can be a jerk on accident for the sake of honesty.

ENTP,I have had a breakfast bar that has filled me up more than you ! 
ESFJ,16. You enjoy giving presents more than getting them. 
ENFJ,"The other thing to consider: there's a good chance he already knows how you feel. I know my friend did, but bottom line is that he didn't want a relationship with me and it wouldn't have mattered if I had told him, waited around for him, etc. If he wanted to be with me, he would have! Distancing yourself from the friendship is always a good option, because if he does end things with her you will be in a better place to strike things up again, or you will met someone else who is available, amazing, and an even better match for you! Best of luck :)    This is GREAT advice. Thank you for posting this. You sound like you've learned a lot in life and have put practical and moral application behind it. You show maturity and growth in this post and I just wanted you to know I appreciate it."
ENTP,"I'm kind of confused. He's shows himself to be really, really dependable.

Because I'm not sure if giving them money would actually help them. I would much rather volunteer at a shelter. A lot of times these people can be drug addicts or alcoholics and will only use that money to fuel their destructive lifestyles. I think the key factor here is the intent behind your refusal to help someone. Is it because you don't want that person to do better? Is it because of a grudge you're holding? Is it because you don't care about the wellbeing of anyone expect yourself? All of these reasons would be immoral IMO.       Originally Posted by emberfly   4.

I installed game ""Starsky and Hutch"". It's old, but worked fine. Overall Vista is stable and reliable so far. Besides support and questionable performance issue it's good OS. Definitely didn't deserve all the hate it has. Too bad people aren't always smart. My experiment has ended. It's been week long experiment and I turned on Windows 10 again on SSD. It was disaster. I found 10 ugly, not really functional, lacking customization options and most importantly hated two control panels. It's not broken installation of 10, it's how it naturally is. It's not that good. I wanted to get back to Vista fast. Vista is much better looking, more functional, more customizable and feels like it was made to be monolith. Everything in Vista is 'Vistaish'. Every icon, style, start menu is made as one OS in mind. Windows 10 borrowed something from Vista, 8.1, 7 and introduced something new, mainly icons. It has weak sense of unity. Plus Vista Ultimate has premium feeling, in Windows 10 you get feeling, that you came back to geometry lesson. It's not beautiful. I have all my files and stuff when I connect Windows 10 hard drives and SSD. I don't have any of that with Vista. Actually I came back to Vista. It's overall better OS and I fully understand people who stayed with 7. I know, that i won't last long with Vista, but I don't really desire to come back to 10. Feels like downgrade and no more beautiful aero. I love that glass environment, feels more high end than just colorful boxes. Vista has the last control panel, where you can actually find something."

ISFP,Both ISFPs and INFPs greatest insecurity is that people will not have high regard for who they are because we are both Fi dominant and Te inferior.

ISFJ,"You know you're an ISFJ when you're the most emotional person ever, but when people need you to be strong, you have no problem being strong for them. ESFJ's are like this too (my mom is one). For example: A few months ago, my great grandma was dying. I was in the hospital room with my family. I was about to cry, but my mom told me she needed me to be strong for her... because that was her grandma after all... After she died, my mom cried while she was hugging me... I just sat there in silence, letting her cry and being her rock like she usually is for me. I didn't let out one tear until I got home. I didn't even know that was possible for me. She thanked me multiple times. We do whatever we have to do to help the people we care about."
ENTJ,"Or just don't give a fuck about anything and just leave? how fast will it be? (like right-away / kinda slowly so it won't be that obvious)    For me, it depends on how I think the other person will react to rejection. If it's just a casual friendship or early stages relationship, I've always been up-front about it, telling the other person why I think it's not going to work out -  that whatever the problem is, it's a deal breaker.  It's not anyone's fault, no one is right or wrong, we're just not compatible.  Part on good terms.  It's a quick, clean cut. "

I was heartbroken, but I never snapped back at her the way this one woman did when she put her arm on her exposed leg.  The situation screamed 'I'm hitting upon you.' To make matters worse there were at least five people around witnessing the whole incident. So it seems like you two,from what I am reading, have already entered a borderline let's take this further relationship. Anything beyond hugging,is fair game for interpretation in my book.

I also notice patterns and in my own self I have noticed once I am with someone I have always crushed on someone else connected to us as a couple. My ex had a nephew and he was younger than I but he was very mature for his age and quiet charming. I found myself being in love with my ex then at the sametime thinking about his nephew and how funny,cute and how much we had in common. Then it came to crushing on him. I secretly wanted him over so I could talk with him. I am introverted of course, so it was more waiting on him to talk to me. But I kept it a secret he didnt have a clue and I made sure no awkwardness was to be shown, I acted as a friend...purely platonic.My rights and wrongs won and my feelings slowly, but surely subsided. I never told him or my ex for fear of being ""judged"" or ""rejected"".... So, now with my much more openminded,accpeting partner I have decided to come out of my shell of ""fake monogamy"" and show my Real self."

My husband finds it hard when (in his words) I am ""inconsistant"" with my moods.  It doesn't help that he is probably one of the most ""consistant"" types, so my moods frustrate him.  For the most part I am very positive and very grounded, but sometimes I am gripped by a melancholic moment of feeling just really negative, and semi-depressed.  He can not cope with this at all.

ISFP,"Back on the subject of femininity, I think part of my problem is that I can be a bit of a misogynist. So I can be a bit detached from womanhood in general. I mean, there's plenty of things I love about it, and embrace and enjoy. I would not want to be anything but who I am, who I was meant to be, designed to be, and who I can better be. But my early discomfort towards women-- particularly loud or obnoxious ones -- makes me feel insecure about myself. I think I early learned to look for ""another way to be a woman"". My own way, according to my own definitions and principles. I think that is why I have such deep-seated sexual problems. I always wanted to be different. Do things my own way, a good way. And so I isolated myself. I shut myself away. I didn't accept the idea of role models that hadn't been screened by my own ideals: ideals like grace, and quietness, and authenticity, and genuine care. And so I don't know how to be one now, by any other standard, including a new one I have approved and realized has value as well; but my sexual frustration is in part that I am trying and trying and trying to be who I am, to be the woman I am, but I misguided my young self somewhere along the way and for some reason never feel I am ""woman enough"". Even though to anyone's eyes, I am wholly woman in every respect. And so I got lonely. I dunno. I feel so detached. And yet attached."
INTJ,"On the occasion I'm watching a football match together with my family - if a team is dominating and outclassing the other, I want them to carry on doing so because they deserve their rewards.

ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Razvan   Well, first of all, it's so good that you are putting yourself out there, you should not stop doing that, because it's the best way to find somebody who can accept you, if people see who you really are, they will love you for who you are and you will find somebody for sure. And further more, trust me on this one, you do not want somebody who cannot accept you for who you are, you will end up even more hurt (I know this from experience). They will just try to change you to fit their view of how somebody should be and that will make you feel insecure, miserable and unhappy with yourself and life. If somebody likes you great, keep that person close, if not, that's cool, let them be and move on, there are a few billion people on this world and all so different, you cannot be liked/accepted by all.

As much as you love him, it's no use to start a potential relationship on shaky foundations! That's not to say you can't be friendly with him, but only if you can handle it (and be truthful with yourself! It's okay if you can't.) I would say only to remain friends if you can do it without motive, otherwise you will basically be waiting for him to break up with her. And yes, there is always the chance that they could break up, but there's no way of knowing when or if that could happen--it could be years of wishing and hoping. Even if they do break up, there's nothing to say he will be ready to jump into another relationship or that it will be with you, per se (not trying to offend, it's just the truth and not a reflection of who you are!) I was once in a similar situation and it was years of pain on my end. "
ESTJ,"How I handle life, could you develop that question? I'm pretty sure it's an interesting one, I just don't see what you want from the question yet.     Hmmm action wise how does it show? This is in relations to liking someone. Are there things you do? Subtle? obvious?"

I've calmly tried to explain to my ESFP lady friend how I felt about some of the things that she was doing that were harmful to me, our work crew, and herself.  It was like I'd stabbed her, she looked so wounded, which was then followed by unspoken anger.  I could tell she was upset with herself, upset with me, and I felt terrible but she knows that I love her.  I wouldn't have taken the time to confront her if I didn't care.  Could you ESFP's please explain why you take criticism so personally?  (By the way you guys look really cute when you're angry .)    Objective criticism is worse!

I don't think we cried, though wearer said and besides the fact that I felt like I have to go because I loved her, I saw only good things coming out of it. I needed to say goodbye, like I said, maybe it's a Perceiver thing but we almost never really breake all connections with somebody. Even now I sort of feel of connection because the memories are still a part of me and I have some really great ones. Plus as I was doing it I was also realising I'd have to do that for my parents too sometime in the future and while it will not be very soon it hit me that I need to make good use of the time I have left with them. It made me appreciate a lot of things even more... I don't generally run from experiences even if they seem negative or with the possibility to bring me down a bit because I can always learn something from them and I feel these make me grow as a person, be more mature. I think every experience we live prepares us for something else, it's a step we needed to take. But I'm not a Fe dominant type, I don't let the emotions of those around me influence me that much, they don't affect me as much as it would affect you so in the end you know what is best for you. I don't know maybe if was also that we don't dead death that much, I don't think anybody shed a tear and we did love her alot. I felt we gathered there to show we loved her and to say goodbye.

Number 8 speaks for itself. Could not agree more. It's usually because we flash people with some sort of outgoing and receptive personality and appear to be very open immediately. This leads them to assume that our personality is primarily this outward mindless enthusiasm. In reality, we're so full of different things that it's impossible and unrealistic to express it all at once. In this way, we need to be 'opened up' for our true versatility to be known, just as an introvert may need to be drawn out. It takes time."

No, he's sure not. I know THEY would look down their nose at him, pick him apart, hold his faults in unforgiving contempt, but that's because people can't stand things that remind them of themselves in an unflattering light to the ego.

Maybe you're thinking about different accidents than I am.    A triangular manhole would be smaller (I imagined a triangle within a circular manhole). If you stretched your legs out in opposite directions the feet would graze the sides of the triangle - you may be able to just slide down to the bottom. Like in an action flick. "

You're overworked and  underappreciated, but how can you fulfill your obligations if your  health is in bad condition?

ISFJ,"When reading a book for example, do you imagine the descriptional part (for example landscapes, rooms, objects brought in sight by description) as being given, can you easily imagine what the book requires to create in your mind?    I tend to visualize the landscape in my head, which is probably why I'm a bit of a slow reader; I like to build a mental landscape. A lot of times the landscape is a combination of the book description and my own creation. My own creation is a mix of my imagination and memories of landscapes from real life. For example, I may envision a fictional town to be much like my hometown, which I adapt to fit some of the book descriptions, which kind of makes it a new town. Also, I tend to picture houses I have memories of as settings for some of the plot, but the yard/location may look different."

ESTP,When you have a very cliche popular person personality that is recognizable almost instantaneously.
ENTP,"There are two kinds of intellectual: Philosophers and Sophists. The former seek the absolute truth, while the latter seek the ""practical"" truth that brings them worldly prestige and success.

Because you're a feeling dominant type, unfortunately some thinking dominant types out there automatically 'logically' assume that us Feelers don't have or aren't able to utilize logic. it's hypocritical and hilarious cos it's totally illogical for them to think that in the first place. I've gotton stuff like ""you're turning into a hot mess!"" when I was just being a bit sarcastic and annoyed, and they'd assume I'm 'hurt' because I was frustrated that they couldn't even understand a concept I was trying to explain to them.

ISFJ,"I think, also, I've kind of grown in a way to suppress my Fe in many situations. One thing that stands out as possibly being Si-Fe to me is that I have a very good memory as far as remembering others' likes/dislikes and remembering almost every conversation I have with others, even if there was nothing special about a particular conversation. Often times I'll bring up a joke and the person will ask if I made that up or heard it somewhere, and I'll have to remind them they're the one who told me that. Or I'll commonly reference a past conversation only to see the person doesn't remember it at all. Over time I've learned to sort of downplay this, or play dumb as far as remembering things, because I worry it can seem weird to people or that people might think I'm taking a special interest in them or something, when in reality I'm not and it's just the way I naturally think. Also, just not being as nice/friendly to people over time because of possibly being taken advantage of in some way, or with people thinking I have some sort of ulterior motive or something, so I just become a little less Fe-ish around people I don't know well over time.

INFP,"Ugh, what the fuck is going on?!? The last few weeks, I've found that my time spent at home, by myself and at work (with colleagues, not friends) I've been more and more... content? stable? yet when I go out with my friends, I feel like I'm basically looking for any little excuse to take something personally and crack the shits. I'm becoming better at suppressing my unfounded frustration, but what the fuck am I to do? I can confess that what someone is doing is pissing me off and risk making them feel like shit and making me look like a crybaby, or otherwise they don't react so badly but I still end up feeling guilty/like shit for feeling like I do in the first place."
INFP,"I hate to make myself look like a fool, but man, I've been craving love a lot lately. Every time I'm chatting with someone, I keep getting this nagging thought in the back of my mind that is telling me that person has someone close to them, who they can share all their deepest thoughts and feelings with, and I don't, which causes me to become jealous. I feel bad to say this, but I dislike being told that I'm a nice guy and etc. etc., because that doesn't solve anything. I probably have no right to even complain about any of this, though. If I really wanted to be close like that to someone, I should be searching my ass off for that special person, right? Why can't I just get lucky like everyone else, though?"

ENTJ,"Not necessarily, I'm happy to do something some one elses way so long as the outcome is an outcome which I desire. It is sometimes a useful ruse to encourage others to believe that they are in control of a given situation. Give's them a sense of security, which may or may not false. That would be a covert demonstration of control, of course a more overt demonstration would be in your notion of dishing out ultimatums."

ENFP,"@Aya the Whaler  said, it is very meaningful and should only be spoken when meant. Once it has, and the relationship has grown and I feel it strongly, not hearing it is worse than anything, for me. I need that reassurance...but, only want it if it's meant. This has only been relevant in one relationship I've had...but, it hurt when she'd be withdrawn and wouldn't even say it, even in response. I'm not even talking everyday...or even week. Lengths of time would pass without hearing it. She had issues with our situation (my kids and her son, from previous relationships, and whose other parent caused issues) so, she told me later she was trying to emotionally distance herself as she felt we needed to separate. She'll never realize how torturous it was but, in the end, we broke up and are now friends (although, love is still there and it is difficult at times)."

But ""anything"" isn't descriptive enough. I just want him to feel loved and appreciated. Right now, he feels unloved and unappreciated because I don't tell him anything. Part of that is he doesn't ask to know anything. When he doesn't ask, I'm not sure if he wants to know and I get stuck on what to say."

ENFP,"See, let's look at the judging functions:Te: External Judging. I appealed to Te by bringing up the most respectable points I could related to such a very vague matter (people's attitudes towards naturally occuring geometry). If a Te user thought it was wrong, they would have presented reasons why, citing more respectable ideas than my own (but I doubt that a study has been done on the matter, so likely they'd have to accept this explanation as the most factual, even though we both know it consists of very little facts).Fi: Internal judging, would have been emotionally moved by the argument. If it decided that it was one it disagreed with, your post would be hugely emotional, which would come off more like a rant and I'd probably not read it. Not so much citing reasons according to the external world, but focusing on why it feels wrong to them.Ti: Internal judging. Accepting the idea through Pe (such as Ne), and then judging via Ti. The conclusion would be logical, the Ni-Te of ""here's a fact, now let's see what it indicates"" would offend here logically, just as Fi was offended morally. Meaning that you'd get a ""this is bullshit"", but since it's an internal judging, will offer absolutely no reasons that are applicable to the outside world."

ENTP,First we must determine if you are adding 5-prostitutes to 5-competent pimps. 
INFP,answer to this question. I see so many people doing things for themselves. Doing whatever it is that makes their lives
INFJ,"I really wonder if (or should I say: doubt that) Jung was an INFJ. On the other hand, the book contains a picture of Jung at age 6 and when you look at they eyes, he could well be. They look like INFJ eyes :-) Not that it proves anything. I'm not sure. carl-jung-age-6.jpgJung 1912.jpg"
ENTJ,"I've observed that types with Fi high in their stack (INFPs, ISFPs, ESFPs, ENFPs) are much more resistant to doing what needs to be done if they aren't naturally comfortable with it or if they simply don't want to. Fi is taking the path of least resistance because 'I want to stay true to myself' even if the path of least resistance leads to somewhere bad."
ENTJ,"If you're asking how to get closer to an ENTJ, try taking initiative. Just make friends and see what happens. If they don't want to be friends with you, you likely don't have any hope of a relationship.    Sorry I worded it wrong. What does an ENTJ see attractive in an ENTP as in a romantic way?"
ISFP,"All that said, I have observed, through the years, that INTJs have this weird attachment to me--as friends, of course. I don't seek out a friendship with them, but they kind of latch on to me as friends. It's never very overt, but I've had a few INTJs friends over the years, and the friendships are the sort that are... well, quiet, with the occasional ""argument"" over theory or something, but not what I'd call dynamic, like with my SJ friends (dynamic not always being a good thing). Ironically, my most ""dynamic"" relationships have been with ENTJs, but despite the ""dynamic""ness of those relationships, there were never hard feelings or hurt feelings. We can argue and fight and insult, etc. but neither party ever feels offended. I don't think I could say that re: INTJs. I have found it possible to hurt their feelings and offend them--never intentionally, and even in the face of my attempts to not to. It's not frequent, but it has happened a couple times. One time, it was pretty much a permanent cutting off on his part. "
INTJ,"Originally Posted by Codger   I need a cold shower after reading all that.    Was it good for you, too?"
ISFP,"I'm in a lot of pain and muddle lately. Physically, mentally, spiritually... I can't feel anything, but yet something is really twisting in me, too. Usually I know what I'm feeling and why and how and how much and what makes it stop, but right now it's like I know nothing about myself. I feel like dying. I can't remember the last time I hated myself anywhere near this much. Hate my life. Hate stuff my ""friends"" do. Hate my interests. I'm so numb. I feel lifeless. And restless. And it's like my eyes and my brain amd my heart haven't rested for 7 years. I am so AWAKE but I feel dead too."
ISTJ,"Ok, I have a real rant. And it is applicable because it concerns my ISTJ hubby :)"
ENFJ,I have written proof of his racism and can wipe his ass in court with this! But my brother in law is too tentative because he's a Pakistani and is afraid that if he takes someone to court over discrimination charges it might have major repercussions. Hate this inability to fight back even when I have the right to ... 
ENTP,"Don't like it, do it yourself and don't bitch about it later."
INFP,and how vital listening to others is to being heard yourself.
INTJ,"Originally Posted by lolthevoidlol   I guess I'm just not as efficient at processing my emotions. I often find that they're in conflict with what is logical or rational and I am loath to go spouting off before I know exactly where I stand. It seems like you figure out where you stand much faster. And when I say they're running in the background that does not mean I am inattentive to the issue. It's a very loud background and becomes the foreground whenever opportunity and capacity align. It's just the ""background"" because it's not all consuming.    Maybe I am too efficient at it, I get way ahead of other people, already identified, processed, compared, translated and on to the resolution before they have even reached identification. That almost seems silly though, to think that I am more emotionally mature, especially since it causes more problems than it solves."
ESFJ,Schedules dealing with finances work  ect ect ... yet those items 
ENFJ,I went through the same after both my grandmothers died. It was the most difficult thing to face in the world. I didn't go to my paternal grand-mother's funeral. And I was in a wheelchair for my maternal grandmother's. Missed both. 
ENTJ,"*sarcasm* I don't have emotions. I am a robot. I am 4% of the human population, I am made of steel. "
ESFP,"I do have a question though. One of my ESFP friends likes to come to me with her problems and such, and sometimes I have advice, and sometimes I don't. But usually when I say something to her, she doesn't seem to listen (or maybe it's just that I don't quite understand what she's saying, so my advice isn't that relevant). Is she coming to me just because she needs someone to talk to, rather than looking for advice? Maybe she just needs to express herself and needs someone to listen? "
INFJ,I get really irritated when people say I'm too young or not old enough to think about certain things. So patronizing.
ESTP,Why do I love engaging in intense arguments with ESTPs? And why does no other type bring out my competitive nature like you guys?
ENFP,Originally Posted by Insert UserName   they are obsessing over the 50th anniversary episode 
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by Prada   Who have you dated more often, introverts or extroverts? I'm asking this because while I'm way more attracted to extroverts, I seem to have real relationships more with introverts so I was wondering if this is common.    About one third extroverts, two thirds introverts. I've initiated with all of the introverts except the INTJ, who seemed to have a master plan to catch me."
ISFP,"Originally Posted by The red spirit   Hardest grammar in the world says something about it and you just can't learn them.    RIP me, then."
ENTJ,"Perhaps a better way to phrase this is - are ENTJ's more likely to doubt one's claim of being an ENTJ than other types for THEIR type (e.g., would an ISFP meet a claim of being an ISFP with less skepticism or doubt)?  Because it seems to be the case, though I'm fully prepared to chalk it up to an extremely small sample size when dealing with other types - I just don't know.    Haven't seen instances of ENTJ identified people mobbed by ENTJs on our sub. On the contrary, I think we've been respectful in that regard by allowing people to self-identify however they wish without giving flak."
ISTJ,"Originally Posted by Hobbes   Never had a massage, and never had a desire for one.  I see no appeal in having some random stranger mess with my body.    My exact sentiments."
INFP,"She afraid if I become bad poor penniless husband like my uncle. What!? Mom I DON'T HAVE GIRLFRIEND!! I'm sorry, I NEVER HAVE GIRLFRIEND. She afraid if I cant socialize. Did she realize I have consider go to mountain penniless and meditate in there. Or just try to go around the world by walking. ect. "
ISFP,"@ferroequinologist , i would have written ""you are ... somewhere ... here"" and placed it any old place. wouldn't that be so way cool - to be somewhere here, but not precisely here. oh wait, are we talking about the fundamental difference between sensor and intuit :P"
ISFJ,"It is a self knowledge thing I learn, and forget quite often;  that to keep a sustainable giving life you must show yourself love. You are of little use to people when you let your tank get too low of fuel to allow you to be a well adjusted human in social/ professional settings."
ISFP,"I am so jelly of my extroverted friends. They are so brave, lively, attractive, and popular. I secretly admire from the sidelines U v U."
ESTJ,"Would you want that change, taking in account how much you gain and lose from it?"
INFP,It's not like I actually want to be in a relationship it's that I want to know that I could be in one that
ENTJ,I also think that attitude can become self-fulfilling.
ISFJ,"I think we can change with life circumstances and getting older.  Also, because he is most comfortable with me perhaps I see more of this outgoing-ness than others and they still see him as quite reserved.  One thing though is that he is a great listener and great at reaching out to others and helping them.  Are ISFJs typically the sorts to reach out to people without any problem?"
ENTP,"Or is it because you all like to argue?    I feel like a celebrity. Just one correction. It's not ""Arguing with Punniez"" but ""Click Here to Witness ENTPs fail to Argue with Punniez"""
ENTJ,"Originally Posted by ALittleSalt   The questions I have are about the first situation. When others hold grudges against my SO after a conflict where he holds none, he has a difficult time mending the situation. From his perspective, he just doesn't see why they don't just do as he did and put the situation behind them. Have you all experienced something like this? Do you just let people (even if they were close friends previously) go in these situations without worrying about it or does it bother you to have to do that? Do you attempt to rebuild the relationship? My SO made one paltry (in my perspective) attempt in the recent situation I have in mind and then let the relationship go, even though I think he does really care... Anything I can do as a third-party to help here or should I not even be that concerned?    When an ENTJ makes a definite call about something that doesn't involve you, don't go against it. It won't received well. He will most likely understand that you mean well but he will be annoyed by it."
ESTP,"What I will say is I think it depends on the emotional and intellectual depth of the estp. The estp who was awesome was more the techy and sporty and combo and well read estp, the dead lay way more of the simpleton hick stereotype. Enneagram likely played a role here.    Yeah but what I meant was, is a guy gonna compare himself not in terms of his sexual ability once in the act, but in the overall aura of dominance and ability to attract. I know that not all ESTPs are great at sex lol, especially if it becomes so regular to become a mechanical reps exercise."
ISFP,"You know you are an idiot when you are an ISFP, a type of people who is known for not being very talkative and prefer actions over words - And you decide to start posting videos on YouTube, where you commentate/talk while playing games. "
ISTJ,"I'm not sure about the psychological or emotional effects it may or may not have had on me. Everyone wants the healthiest, happiest relationship possible and I'm no exception. Too bad I have no way of experiencing both (abstinence and sinning so to speak), and making a comparison to see whether I'm indeed missing out on something here. ;) "

INFJ,"I'd like to sit atop a freeway exit sign and wave as cars pass by while sipping on an iced coffee.  All the better if I have a friend with me partaking in such a random but seemingly fun activity.  Can the freeway exit sign carry our weight?  Not sure, but this is why this is but a thought."
ESTP,"Thing to keep in mind, ESTP's tend to bond over experiences and express ourselves via actions more than words. People seem to assume ESTP's talk a lot. But we're the doers. The key way we express ourselves is in our actions. Spending time with and taking care of people we value. Individually, we might go about it in different ways. But essentially, it's the same thing.

ISFP,"Originally Posted by ok not what i meant   What's it like in Lithuania? Do you view learning a new language as an opportunity, or does it feel more like a chore?    Did I say that my native language is Lithuanian and I was born here too. Learning languages is good thing if you know how to use them later. It's bad if it's forced and just for sake of learning. Also this summer I was in Greece and with my knowledge I could understand some of the words, to me they were like mix of Lithuanian and Russian with small amount of English, but I never needed this. I would want to learn Japanese, but it's very hard and reason for learning is mangas and anime. Generally I like learning languages, because when you go abroad and you can understand something is really good feeling."
ISTP,"Yep, stereotypes bite.    I'm not sure what being manly means exactly, but I would define it as being yourself and not afraid of how other perceive you. Back in the earlier years, I would guess that society saw being manly meant being an ISTP, at least according to the movies. Fixing cars, staring off at nothing, not giving a shit attitude, etc. "

He only took the MBTI test once, and he said that he thought the whole MBTI thing was ridiculous and silly, but he scored as an INTP and I think he fit the bill pretty well, even though I only knew him online.  Anyway, he would always IM me a lot, and because we were so different from each other, I sometimes would ask him ""Why do you like to IM me so much?"" and he pretty much said ""Because you're very interesting.""  I wasn't bothered by him IMing me so often, but I just didn't understand why he did it, especially since we disagreed on a number of things and had a number of different interests.  Of course, he may not have been an INTP."

But.. don't you get jealous?  Maybe you like somebody, but don't want to make a 'thing' of it and maybe he or she brings one of his 'interests' along one day.  How do you feel, what do you do?    Oh sure, I get jealous.  But that's true pretty much across the board.  If I'm entertaining a group of people and someone comes into the room and steals the spotlight, then I'm jealous in that situation too.  I want the attention focused on me, and anytime it's not, I'm restless and want it back.  So it's not really any different with somebody I'm attracted to, I'm gonna want ALL of their attention, but I can logically realize that isn't going to happen and deal with it."

ISTJ,"However, I believe that once there is a sincere (not merely professed) belief or faith in Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for our sins, that a change takes place that will make the desire to ""continue stealing"" lessen. It isn't to say we will never sin again, but that our heart will change and when we do err, we will recognize our mistake and be truly repentant of it. I am not in the business of determining whose faith is or is not genuine, but Jesus said that His followers would bear the fruit of their faith in Him. If someone says they are a Christian, but continues in sin with no apparent remorse, some may feel they are not bearing fruit. However, since we cannot know another's conscience, and what struggles they go through, it makes it a bit difficult at times to judge a Christian based on their ""fruit"" alone. Yet one who has true faith would strive to grow and not continue doing things they believe to be wrong."

ENTJ,"- Sucked it up, suppressed my Fi (value I suppressed: passion), got a high-paying job in management consulting instead and was able to afford to travel extensively to those ancient sites (23 cities in 14 countries so far).

ISTJ,"Long story short, he could have reacted with more understanding, maturity, and perhaps a sense of humor. For only the second time since I've registered on PerC, I was relieved to come back to the ISTJ board after lurking. Amusingly enough, even though I do plenty of lurking around on the other boards, both times that I found these ridiculous topics, they were talked about on here and peeked my curiosity to go check it out.    Being a thinker does not make one emotionally mature, nor does it eliminate the possibility of acting really stupid. I can personally testify to that, as I've been guilty of both, at times."

ENFJ,When I think about the lies I have told others it is over things like who I'm with or what I'm doing. You're right that it does not help and it is extremely disrespectful to the person I'm lying to. It creates mistrust and can cause animosity between people. It doesn't feel good and it usually blows up in your face.

Of course, I am an excellent student and I blow them away with my essays and projects and mostly when we have debates on certain topics (as it is expected from an ENTP )"
INFJ,I hear the term paraded around so much and I really hope that people aren't talking about Fort Knox vault like doors when they refer to it.  Because people that aren't scared away forever in the hustle and the bustle usually deserve to be let back in without resorting to high explosives.

ISFJ,"People do evolve, and sometimes it can lead to them realising their mistake. It depends on the occasion, so I believe that sometimes it is okay to accept a friend into your life again.

To be honest I don't think he wants it either (which is kind of annoying, because it would have been a lot more satisfying to know that he was sad about this as well, haha), so I don't see us becoming friends again in the foreseeable future."
ENTP,"Violence is obviously the most sensible way to go. Look at how spoiled the children are today. A good old beating is apparently the only thing that works.

Would this leave a lasting impression on her?

Not a female, but I'll try to come with some input. Do you know what her love language is? In the case of flowers and that kind of gifts, I think that matters more than type.

I'm picking up bad traits from him. I'm an incredibly strong willed, opinionated, outgoing girl but with him, I've become so timid due to his insecurities and lack of trust. I barely ever go out because he will question it, I barely ever work because he isn't a fan of my job, I've completely cut out my male friends because he doesn't really trust me. I'm most ashamed of this. I had told myself once I began understanding the complexities of relationships that I wouldn't be the girl to be under a mans thumb. I wouldn't beg for a man to have me.

ISFJ,"Originally Posted by Supplant3r   Judging by what you said, especially about tensing up when you look in his direction, he probably is interested in having a relationship with you.  I don't think there is any easy solution to this except for just being patient and seeing what happens, and if he opens up to you, you'll have to kindly turn him down if you aren't interested in him.    Yikes...alright, I'll have to be careful, then. Thanks."
ESFJ,When you get grossed/weirded out by anything and everything... is being a picky eater common??
ENTP,Originally Posted by FueledByEvil   Welll I get out of bed in the morning. Thats bad enough.    #feelsbadman
INTP,"Originally Posted by crazyeddie   With evo-devo, the line between nature and nurture blurs. I suspect that reading is becoming as natural to humans as spoken language, and that dyslexia is slowly being breed out.    I'd like statistics on dyslexia and any other disabilities that may be breeding out before I believe it. It seems highly likely, though."
INFP,Sometimes I wish I could just go back in time and revisit those touches
ENFJ,"Originally Posted by Jawz   I lucked out with my school experience as I got to go to one of the preppy schools in my city [the one where all the Mr and Ms Perfects from Rich homes get to go to - even though it was a public school]. But --- there were a few bullies at my school as well and when I look back at my high school experience, all I remember is that for some of those kids [later I found out that one of the bullies got arrested for drug pushing, while another dropped out of the first year of college and ended up doing odd jobs at various places], that's the only experience they're going to have. "
ISFJ,"Ex. ISFJ male is very sweet, loyal, and endearing.  One day an argument begins and is blown out of proportion by both parties, however, ISFJ male becomes mean, harsh, and dismissive.  I know everyone can act differently when angry/upset, but I'm talking about acting like a completely different person, or having actual intent to hurt someone with just their words because he's upset.    Hrm...maybe I've never met someone who's really irritated me, but I can't remember myself doing something like that :D"
ESTP,What do you ESTP's think?    I dunno O_o too little and generic (can't stand lies) or even irrelevant information (loves dogs)... some of it could easily be ESFP too (doesn't like any structure)
ISTJ,"Normally this is the fun stuff, but because whoever wrote the damn thing failed to comment ANY of their code, i'm now stuck working through line by freaking line deciphering it as i go."
ISTJ,*Goes back to enneagram poll to see how many Type 1 ISTJ regulars are left*
ESTP,"In general, how much alone time do you need, and when do you need it?"
INFJ,"Originally Posted by My Own Worst Judge   I do understand being protective of your friend so she doesn't end up with a jerk.    Yeah, that!"
ENTJ,"I'm asking based on observations of how ENTJs responding in this thread seem to all have a similar drive towards this ideal, and as an INTJ, my experience has revolved more around just ""being"" than pushing in a particular direction. I plan and maintain a course, but generally take life experiences at a more casual pace so as to leave room for re-evaluation. As such, the characteristics normally attributed to a more ambitious, adult-centered mindset (like maturity) are more like a suit that I only put on when necessary. With ENTJs on the other hand, it sometimes seems like it's been sewn into their skin, which gets me curious."
ESTP,"I mean, it was a joke? It'd be just sad if it wasn't."
INFJ,Originally Posted by Aubbs   I feel like I am having a conversation with a bunny on something. Are you?
INTP,"Originally Posted by Snakecharmer   Have you ever been in someone's home and noticed a photo of someone, and you just KNEW that person was no longer among the living?  Eerie.    If you knew an elderly person and didn't know if that person was dead or alive (because you haven't seen him or her for a number of years), but had reason to suspect that he or she was dead (from natural causes, diseases, and so on), would your perception of that person change?

ISTJ,"I'm for now keeping it limited to choosing specific days and events that fit everyone's schedule nicely. Otherwise, it's just a matter of going to school-sponsored stuff and asking people if they're going or not."
ESFJ,"My wife is an ESFJ. I have read this entire thread (INTP for the win?) and concluded that very little of what was said cannot be attributed to my wife. Positive feedback or negative, in some form or another these traits are indicative of my wife -- good days, bad days, idiosyncratic days -- but I cannot leave it at that."
ENTJ,"For example:    I can switch hit in baseball/softball,  can golf from either side, and have pretty good hand-eye coordination.  Whenever I learn a new skill, I test it out both ways and see which hand is the better choice."
ESFJ,"Please give an example of moral crusading, I'm interested.  :-)"
ISTP,"Originally Posted by Randroth   Drop whatever you're doing and go watch the shit out of Pacific Rim.    I actually went to the theater yesterday to watch whatever. I decided on Pacific Rim, but then the person selling the tickets told me it was in 3D. I get headaches watching 3D movies, it's those damn glasses!"
ENTJ,"Other than lying, manipulation by fake victimisation is high on the list. Case in point: friend who lied about wanting to date a guy who was interested in me, contacts him on the side to try to get something going. Tells me to my face she is not interested in him, but sees him anyway. Then accuses me of ""not telling her"" that I was going out with him (which is a ""for fuck's sake?"" moment for me because I was simply going out to dinner/drinks with the guy and always maintained I wasn't thinking as far as if he would make boyfriend material). I know she doesn't want to hear about the details because she is genuinely interested in my well-being; she's being nosy so she can benefit herself, all the while playing the ""I'm so old nobody wants me"" card."
ISTP,"I thought about picking up the troll mantle myself, but since I actually like people and hate drama, it wouldn't work for me. :("
INFJ,"New job involves ""training"" and leaving me too tired to post much, but couldn't resist letting everyone know that dogs are a lot stronger than they let on.  Learning to clip nails and the critters have serious muscle power in those skinny limbs.  Like an ugly wrestling match, me breaking a sweat, boss looking on amused (but not helping), dogs win, paws down (pun intended.)the_pawsh_dog_1006007.gif"
INTJ,So ask away!    Do you feel lonely? I was curious as I thought it was explicitly an 'E' thing.
ISTJ,"SO....did he/she ask you ""What kind of animal are you?"" or ""What are your weaknesses?"" :)"
ENTP,Originally Posted by Rune   Do ENTPs usually use their Fe impulsively?
ENFP,Originally Posted by sweatherbee5   What is something you guys think is unique to ENFP's? Something most other types can't do or something? :o
ESTP,What is the most reckless thing you have ever done?? And how did it play out :P
ISTJ,"So I took my turn to ""train"" him. I rang him up relentlessly starting from half an hour prior to the appointed time, threatening to beat his ass if he didn't show up on time. "
ENFJ,"I guess it's like most other Fe-users I've met - it works, only so long as there is a certain distance between us. We're drawn to eachother... but when we get even a fraction too close the result is a big unstable, no-worky mess. A mess which just works to highlight my own severe social inadequacy."
ESTJ,An ESTJ's ethics or morals are soley dependent upon something other than personality type. 
ENFJ,Oh yeah. And no one takes me seriously. I'm not viewed as a very in-depth person.
ISFP,"Do you relate to not shoving your emotions down other's throats? If not, how do you express your emotions with others?"
ISFP,And she knows it. But won't suppose it. And that just does it.
ESTP,"how often do you find yourself thinking one thing and saying another just for the sake of appearances?    Usually, I say what's on my mind. Unless it's unpractical. If I think a person is a dick but I need to get along with them, I'll keep my thoughts to myself."
ENTP,"Thanks, got it. (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,""script"",""ld-ajs"");"
ENTJ,I also think that trying to out-8 other people on a forum is an exercise in futility.
ESFP,These people are going to nuke the entire planet unless you rape this person in front of you.
INTJ,This looks like an interesting thing to do with me when I'm dead.
ENFJ,"I'm trying to become less impulsive though and properly access a situation before acting, because some of these people I defend are story teller ESFPs who emblelish the truth a bit to make their plight look more dramatic."
ENFP,Originally Posted by letter_to_dana   It's more secure for me if I let them chase me... That's how I can take my time into thinking whether ot not I really want that relationship to go deeper.
ISFJ,"I probably don't speak for all ISFJs (especially females), but here is what I would say:"
ISTP,Originally Posted by Nubb   I swear I can predict the future.
ENTP,can't we just entertain something out of pure intellectual curiosity?
ISTP,Whereas I get sensory overload but can still focus and get shit done. 
ESTJ,"So from cognitive functions theory I'm going to say the idea of ESTJ ~ traditional and all that is crazy, and that they can fit a lot of what is often associated to INTJ. Part of this is that N has essentially gotten overblown in association to having a non-aversion to theory and the like."
INFP,I just read THe hitchhiking game in laughable loves it really made me think of him. I love Kundera he always makes me think.
INTJ,We had a boom where I live around about the time I bought this house.  I was just on the cusp of it.  The house had risen 30k in around 5 months.  The house that I'm paying off is now 3 times it's original value.  Wages haven't risen enough for people to be able to adequately pay for the housing hike.
ENFP,"Originally Posted by carteblanche   Another question that came to mind. ENFP's do you find it hard to forgive? If yes, how? If no, why?"
ISFP,"But you see, in his world, it's just that he's number one"
ISFP,"My lover's an ISFP and she's tearing away at my Fi like there's no tomorrow. Normally, I'd tell her to fuck off and stay fucked off but I love her and I made some kind of personal commitment to her that I don't want to give up on just because I'm not strong enough."
ISFJ,"Originally Posted by izebize   I'm interested in politics, which does not mean that I would ever get into it. I just like to be up-to-date about recent events and knowing the programs of the parties. (Probably comes from being an SO first in Enneagram)"
ESFJ,me: Mom...you turned it off.... *turns laptop back on and it was back to normal*
ISFP,"Thank you so much!! I must run to work. But could I message you for some more insight, perhaps a follow up question in the future?"
ESFP,"But i ve learned that not everyone was like that and after beein burned quite hard in another ""big company"" i left that job.   "
ISFP,"there is not much holding the relationship together, and you want to be free"
INFP,"Originally Posted by periculosa   Emotions definitely hinder me also.  I did manage to successfully ignore them for perhaps ten years...then emotion came knocking, and knocked down the whole false house I built for myself.  I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse to discover I am INFP."
ENFP,Sent from my XT907 using Tapatalk    Ruining people's lives through false motivation.
ENTJ,Now I didn't mean behavioural problems as in needing a padded room and/or heavy meds (although looking back....)
ISTJ,Her:  I hear you're taking two days off this week.  (Strike 2:  I dislike the rumor mill/It's none of her business).
INFJ,"Originally Posted by Aizar   I knew this comment was going to be made.  No, I'm not.    Haha, no worries. I do understand being protective of your friend so she doesn't end up with a jerk."
