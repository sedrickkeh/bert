"ESFJ	I don't know that I can point to one or two specific people that I consider role models as much as I notice small things people do that I admire. I will notice a gesture of kindness or an act of selflessness someone does and then I'll try to incorporate that into the way I treat others as well. I admire people whose actions and words align and who are consistently a good person and aren't arrogant or pompous. I appreciate other people who work on being inclusive and considerate.

"ESFJ	How often are you approached by someone new?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	What are the most likely circumstances that you are approached?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	These questions are confusing to me. Maybe that's because I feel like I interact and talk to all sorts of people on a daily basis. There pretty much isn't anyone I feel I can't chat up and somehow people come up to me and are comfortable talking to me too even if I don't really know them too well or just in passing. So I guess the answer would be I'm approached often by people I know and people on the outskirts of my circles. People who are absolute total strangers will sometimes greet me in passing going to the grocery store or chat me up in the post office in the waiting line or at a coffee shop trying to figure out what to order / kill time waiting in line. Or if I see another mom having a hard time with their toddler's tantrum somewhere", I'll say a word of support to the mom and she'll start talking with me or something like that. I mean, pretty much anywhere people are who need to fill time with small talk, basically. Haha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Originally Posted by providence   What does your ideal day look like?    Wake up around 7am", have breakfast with my family, drop kids off at school, go to yoga, get some tea / coffee with a friend and catch up, run errands / be productive getting things done, get kids from school and chat with them about their day, cook dinner with my husband and eat as a family, put kids to bed and spend the rest of the night watching a show with my husband or meeting up with some of my girlfriends at their house. So I guess, a pretty typical day where everything runs smoothly.

"ESFJ	For instance", this week I noticed it was one of my kids' teachers birthday (via Facebook) and wished her a happy birthday that morning and my daughter decided on her own accord she wanted to make her a card. The teacher was really surprised and touched to read it and that someone would remember. I also wrote a friend (outer circles / acquaintance) of mine in town who is nearing the end of her pregnancy and told her I know how crazy it is at the end to find care for your other kids while you go into labor and I could definitely watch hers for her if she wants (our kids are in the same class etc). She was so relieved because she has no family in town and didn't know what else she would do. She never asked me or hinted on it but I just knew this would be a nice thing to help someone out. Or the other day in passing I told someone I know that I read his article he wrote for the student paper and thought it was wonderful and his face lit up and he was excited it reached other people and meant something to them. Just a few examples, but you get the point. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	@Ashes4719 ", dealing with arguments as an ESFJ married to an INTP is tricky sometimes. Fortunately, we've been married for 10+ years now so it's gotten easier. He tries to split hairs on wordings of things and used to in the past try to make everything sound like it had to be totally logical (like emotions weren't valid arguments, etc). Little things I just let go and for big things, we found it's usually best for him to take some introverted alone time and cool down (even though I as an extrovert want to talk about it immediately... but that usually ends up badly so we've found over the years to just let the introvert go get some space for awhile then come back and talk). Once we reconvene to talk more calmly," there are times in the past when I just back peddle and think in my head this isn't worth it and let's just get along again and move forward. Now I've gotten better at actually talking through things and not back peddling just to avoid conflict. He's gotten better at validating my feelings and realizing there's a ""feeler logic"" that may not always stack up with concrete facts etc. Without that realization", it was hard at the way beginning of our relationship because I felt really misunderstood and he in return felt very frustrated by not understanding what was happening logically plus getting flooded by confusing emotions (mine and his).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I think ENFJs might be different"," I don't know. But the ENFJ friend I know is much more out spoken and for lack of a better word ""aggressive"" in arguments and very stubborn. She makes me feel uncomfortable when she gets like that and makes me feel like she doesn't actually want to hear anyone else's perspective because she's so locked into her own and kind of ""attacks"" (although I don't think she sees it as that) people who speak up and differ from her viewpoint. I don't know if this is just me or an ESFJ thing but I feel like I keep pretty calm and while I can totally be stubborn too and think I'm right"," I'd rather have peace and calm than always be ""right."" In the end"," no one truly ""wins"" arguments in a relationship because you still have to live with this person forever so proving that you're ""right"" and being stubborn about it really only drives the other person away....which in the end hurts you because you want to have a good relationship with your partner and not just be the winner and alone. One of the many reasons I try to be careful with my wording during heated arguments is because I know at some point we'll make up again but I don't want to regret the words I've said because I truly love this person and want to have a harmonious family. And to be totally honest", I expect more of myself and slumming it during fights makes me look bad to myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This right here! In my realtionship this can turn a small argument into a large one. My INTJ will nit pick the hell out of my wording and I hate it.

I don't know why but I have noticed that ENFJs do have a very strong opinion I guess you could say. I see it in myself and other ENFJs but I have really tried to work on it. Sometimes I just think something is right because to me its obvious and morally right even though to someone else it is not true for them. I think this can be part of the issues with the arguments I have had with my partner. He finds things very logical and it must be right because it's logical while I am on the other end saying it must be right because it makes others/me feel this way. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I also agree with the point you made about always being ""right"". I know that is so stupid and immature but sometimes I do feel like that so I do definitely need to work on just trying to comprise since I do love this person and want to be with them. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Anyway", just as a disclaimer, I am not always arguing with my partner! I was re-reading my messages and was like oh my gosh I make it seem like I am in this unhappy relationship. I am very happy, I just wanted opinions on how others dealt with arguments in relationships since they are bound to happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	@Ashes4719 ", no worries! Never thought even for a second that you all argue a lot or anything like that. All people in relationships have disagreements and I read somewhere in some psychology paper that the way couples resolve these fights are more indicative of their future success than whether or not they ever have an argument. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm not sure if this will help you with an INTJ", but I have found with my INTP husband that I can't argue in his wheelhouse. Like anytime I would try to defend my side with pure logic and no emotion," I immediately lose. There's just no logic on logic fighting with an INTP that I'm going to win. They'll always find that one word that you said that could be taken a different way. That was hard sometimes because I honestly didn't even remember what I said because it was more about the feelings behind the words than the actual dictionary definition. So then he felt like I was being evasive and changing my ""story"" when I would say I didn't remember saying those words or something like that. I wanted him to get the emotions and he wanted to get the words and we just talked right past each other into a world of hurt. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	What I've realized is that back then I felt sometimes like he should just ""know"" what I mean when I talk about feelings things (because it's SO obvious to me)", but the truth is...he just didn't. Sometimes he needed to piece together the facts of the timeline of events before he could get to the emotions. And for me," it's like I just want him to get why I'm so upset and the feelings involved and the rest of it doesn't matter. But now we've found a better way to talk about it. He tries to validate my feelings and I'll try to find ways to make things a little less emotionally charged or directed (he would totally just shut down and not even try to listen if he felt I was directing my emotional anger at him vs just wanting to be understood).

"ESFJ	Anyway", hope some of that made sense. Enjoyed reading your posts!    Yes, your input has totally helped! I am so glad I read these posts and asked if anyone else had any ways to get through arguments with their SO. I also have tried to logically argue with him but it never works so I will try to just explain in my point of view. I just have tried to bridge that gap but the same thing will happen with me. I forget my words but remember the meaning and I end up confusing my boyfriend even more because I used synonyms and I don't even remember what I said because I was just upset. So, that is a good idea and I think I am going to try and use that next time to explain my feelings more. He also gets overwhelmed with feelings so that is why I have backed off but I think I just need to get better at communicating with him and trying to explain my point from a level headed perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	On another note", I'm sorry for the experiences you've have in the past, it is tough being bullied. My apologizes if any of my comments come off too blunt or offensive, as it is not my intention! I believe that you should maybe make a list of all your stressors in life and to jot them down from most important to least important (like your call to the collections agency being the top). Then one by one you can attempt to complete them with a resolution. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to ask for options on what you can do, most of the times people will only help if they are asked. I know it will seem like a lot all at once, but it will at least be organized enough for you to tackle the stresses in your life!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	yeah", doing chores gives me the same feeling that I had when I had jobs, I feel very good about myself to just do simple stuff and be respected/appreciated for it, I don't like a lot of praise but just to know they're glad I did it is very good to know so I don't feel like it was in vain, money is necessary for life so having jobs was also great for that, plus I like earning money for stuff I don't need but want, and even just doing the work physically is sometimes fun for me, I try to mix a professional and fun attitude, but my coworkers didn't share my passion, they were so serious it scared me and made me want to push back against that a little, but in the end they won, I got fired, oh well, you live and learn and I guess I keep learning the hard way that some jobs don't allow me to be silly      Originally Posted by Executie   On another note, I'm sorry for the experiences you've have in the past, it is tough being bullied. My apologizes if any of my comments come off too blunt or offensive, as it is not my intention! I believe that you should maybe make a list of all your stressors in life and to jot them down from most important to least important (like your call to the collections agency being the top). Then one by one you can attempt to complete them with a resolution. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to ask for options on what you can do, most of the times people will only help if they are asked. I know it will seem like a lot all at once, but it will at least be organized enough for you to tackle the stresses in your life!    my experience with bullies wasn't that bad in comparison to the stories you hear out there, it didn't last very long, I got into some fights, I almost got arrested once for trying to stab a kid with a paper clip because he kept bugging me for a whole week, I kicked another kid in the shins and made him bleed for talking about my mother and sisters like objects to please his libido - I don't remember getting in trouble for that, I don't regret it to this day, I probably wouldn't do that to anyone again because I've changed, but I'm very defensive about anyone talking about the women in my family like that - other than that, a lot of bullies I confronted them with my words and they left me alone after that, I talked them away, that was when I got older and realized that getting physical was taking a toll on my weak body, I didn't enjoy it, and I got into a lot of trouble for doing that because someone always found out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	I appreciate the advice to get organized", but I've got it organized in my head and heart, and I don't like to be much more organized than that because I feel limited lol - hey who knows, maybe some day I'll be ready to confine myself to some order and do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just based on what you've explained to me in these posts, I cannot relate to them at all. You seem like an ESFP to me because you care about your appearance, you're more silly/fun at work, like doing what you want to do rather than what you should do, you seem to have a hard time understanding other people's emotions, crave attention in a sense, and seem to be more functional when spontaneous. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	My best friend is an ESFP Male and you seem to be like him. He is probably healthier than you are (in terms of awareness", not actual health), but he lives his life by approaching it one step at a time and enjoying every moment that comes by. Try to be yourself and those who like you will naturally approach you. If they do not like you, then drop it. Friends come and go, you just got to deal with it as best as you can. Try to have a more optimistic approach in life, whenever you notice a negative try to see the positive. My ESFP friend tends to be kind of like a lost puppy, but I gave him advice on how to organize his life a bit and he eventually got to a point where he could live his life based on what makes him happy while managing a job to pay for his bills. Embrace who you are and stop living to other people's standards because we are all different and hold different values. I value security and my ESFP friend values happiness, we live totally different lives but we both are thriving in our own standards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it is important to develop an understanding of where people are come from because it can help you with seeing things in your life in different perspectives that you may have considered failures.

"ESFJ	I have an INTP friend that is ridiculously smart"," but always doubts herself.

When she got laid off a few years ago", her choices were obvious:  either take some shit job somewhere, or go to university and get her degree.  She has been going to school a few years now and is working toward her MFA.  She thinks that she would like to teach at the university level eventually but is afraid of failure.  I have reassured her about 4521545133 times that she'll do fine NOT because she is organized (she is not), but because it's obvious that she takes a great deal of interest in the subject matter and actually WANTS to impart that knowledge to others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	What do you think of dates?    You know", it's so amusing to me because I don't know any INFPs and really want to because I feel I would be compatible with them. I feel this way with INTPs too, but I only know one INTP and we get along great. These are probably the few types I'd consider dating based on my past relationships with an ENFP and ISTP. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Coming from an ESFJ", I had a hard time saying no for the longest time until recently because of my relationship with an ex who was ISTP. I learned a lot from him and he taught me what I needed for myself and deserved in a relationship," which meant that I definitely needed to date an N person haha. I used to say ""Maybe"" as a way to avoid conflict of saying no and feeling bad. It's definitely something where we ESFJs need to work on our inferior Ti to think about what we want and what is and isnt appropriate in a situation. Funny story", I recently began using my Ti more and my INTJ and INTP friends were saying how if I relied on it too much I'd start to act like an INTP lol. I began to do that and they would yell at me and tell me to stop being that way, which is why I was so intrigued with your responses. They felt relatable in a way, but I see that I have to use my Ti in moderation to be balanced enough with my Fe dom. The ESFJ you were talking to probably was just unaware and more unhealthy if anything. Not all ESFJs are that way, and just need a motive to change their perspective so long as you word it in a way that we can understand. In my experience I found dating people is where I made my biggest changes and growth in life. It's interesting to see how you do it differently because it gives me a different perspective in the approach. It makes me want to learn more from you. :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	It seems the types I would like to get to know more dont linger in the settings I put myself in lol. I tend to be around S people more", which is why they don't usually jump at the topic when I bring up MBTI. I agree, once people type themselves they seem to take the description of it too literally but that's why I think discussions and having friends to talk it out with you are important to see that they are like a set of guidelines, but more like a key to growth.

"ESFJ	Since I've started I'll go first... bit of a pathetic one this I admit to start with:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm usually one of the first people in the office in the morning and I'll usually race to be first to the coffee machine to get a brew going. My colleagues think I'm being decent and helpful for doing this. Reality", I secretly think they are rubbish at measuring out the correct amount of coffee, and I want to ensure I enjoy my morning coffee at the strength I like it .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	A friend of mine was telling me about a book her therapist gave her relating to self-esteem. Apparently the book said to talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend. She gave the example that you wouldn't tell your friend she looks like a fat cow in that outfit", so why would you say that to yourself? All I could think is," ""yes", you'd never say that," but what if you'd be thinking it?"" ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	OK", maybe that snobby cheerleader thing isn't just a stereotype!

"ESFJ	I secretly don't like hosting people or throwing kid's birthday parties at our house. I put way too much pressure on myself for the house to look perfect and have the food be something everyone likes plus having to get all 3 little kids dressed decently and myself and then be like the fun hostess. It's just a lot. Then the whole time I'm also thinking about if everyone's enjoying themselves or what can make people more comfortable etc. Just a lot of work and then the house is a wreck afterwards...even though I feel I've been cleaning after people all day. I much rather have friends who are super outgoing and love to host and then go to their events. Lol! Way less pressure and more fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	(I also don't like picking out the background music because I don't know what type of music everyone likes... I totally overthink it. lol! I'm sure no one would ever know that from the outside)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm sure no one would ever know that from the outside)    Aww - I hear you on the making things perfect piece - I actually like it", but I always worry so much before I have a party that I make everyone around me nuts! Once it starts, I'm ok, but getting there...ay yi yi!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Another confession. I worried for several hours after initially posting this thread thinking it might to go down like a lead balloon with potential disapproval from my fellow ESFJs of my slightly selfish coffee making antics ha-ha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Is it possible to request that a thread be made sticky?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Haha",  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	@orion83uk  that totally made me laugh (in a good way)! So relatable. :) Thanks for creating this post. And yes", with how sloooowww things move here it's hard to get that instant feedback. I hear you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	@Happy29 ", Yes! So much that! I do have fun during and later on am glad I did it, it's just the before that gets insane (and well the during can be a pretty crazy with little kids too). I have to wonder if someday when my kids are older if the hosting part will be more fun. Right now it seems way more stress than it's worth when I can still have a great time (better time) at other people's events. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Thanks for the fun read! Nice to see a few ESFJs out here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm lonely. I don't have any friends", even though I always try really hard to make friends. I feel like no one cares about me, and I don't know why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	@The Penguin ", hugs to you!! I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Do you want to talk about it (maybe in a new thread)? I'm sure you'd find some listening ears here and people who do care. Hoping things get better for you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hoping things get better for you!    Thank you. I have tried a few times, talking about it in my own threads, with a few different situations. People usually want a lot of personal details," so they can ""help"" but I'm not comfortable giving those details online to total strangers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm loving", giving, helpful, nice, sweet, caring, personal, maybe a little too moody for my own good. I'm just hoping that it gets better someday. It's just hard for me to trust people because when I try, I feel like they just push me away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Do you have some kind of trust issues", (or anxieties) or just   you  have  experienced people pushing you away, because of your moodiness ? If your  moodiness looks similar to that, when you turn into ESTP 8w7  on this forum,  I  could see why ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	@The Penguin ", I'm really sorry to read your post there. Could we start a new thread and chat?    I'm too worried about someone showing up and posting something rude, just to make me cry, because some people are toxic like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	How about Private Messaging?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	My confession is that I actively smile at people and nod when they speak although I disagree with what they're saying in that moment. I just want to give them a good feeling and appreciation. Then I decide if I tell my opinion or if I let it go based on how much trust I have in our relationship. I know I fake it but it's more important to make them feel good than to tell everyone my opinion. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Also", I look at other people and think that they do not care about their facial expressions when someone is talking in a meeting. They sit there like robots but it's not hard to smile, nod or do something to show that you listen. That makes me feel Superior to other because I think have this awareness but it also make me second-guess myself because I really care and don't want to be fake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Originally Posted by orion83uk   Another confession.

"ESFJ				",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ			   Lol. That is a very unexpected reaction. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	But is your behavior really selfish? You have standards and you're implementing them", not just for yourself but also for others whose standards are not up to par. So, you're doing them a favor, right? If coffee helps them get through morning, then you're not only handling the coffee-making, but you're also improving their mornings, which then consequently results in better productivity. That improves your employer's bottom line in the long term. That's not selfish at all! ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Another thought: they might know how terrible their coffee is and might not have the courage to admit it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	WHAT'S UP EVERYONE ON THIS SUBFORUM. I would like to introduce myself. I am Temizzle. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	So as of late", it has come to my attention that according to armchair self-proclaimed internet stranger typologists I am a certified ESFJ!! Congratulations to you all as you have just earned yourself a killer member on your team!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Let me begin by talking a little bit about myself so that you can be certain of my ESFJness. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	First thing's first. I hate it when people pity themselves and act helpless to their life circumstances. I can't count the number of times somebody has come to me crying", broken, shattered, and I don't do so much as bat an eye remaining stone cold and offering no support or pity. What is my go to? In the dryest tone imaginable, I will point out how they came to the fucked up situation they are at, and what they need to do to change it. The advice usually involves them sucking up their self pity and growing a pair of fat fucking balls. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Next. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I loathe tradition", I hate social niceties. I will not dance for the sake of dancing. I will not sing for the sake of singing. If a group of people is smiling dancing having a great time and need me to oblige and partake in order to preserve the social atmosphere I will stubbornly refuse and sit there stone cold and non-participating no matter what, even if that means ruining it for everyone else there. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Next. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I love to argue with people for the sake of arguing. I love challenging people for the thrill of the challenge and besting them. I was the kid that would challenge my peers to fights for the sake of it", for races for the sake of it, to chess matches for the sake of it. I am that obnoxious know-it-all in class that enjoys raising their hand and providing really snooty answers that demonstrate to the professor that the class is way too easy for me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	When I was much", much younger," my car was a horrible mess.  I started actually tending to it (the one I had at the time) about the time I turned 30.

I tend to always do the right thing when inwardly seething about when is it my turn to be loved", appreciated, etc until I get my fill and I blow up in a tearful FE mess about how no one ever cares about me, loves me, appreciates me, etc (it is quite a pathetic sight) Then I feel ashamed and the process starts over. I get very irritated when I am in the middle of something and someone interrupts. So therefore I am really starting to think I am closer to an introvert.

He made me join coitillion because ""manners/social skills never go out of style."" He thought I was a weird kid and this would miraculously turn me into a pretty little princess. It was basically torture. I was kicked out the second week because a boy asked me to dance and we were supposed to be lady like and curtsy.

Though I default as an extrovert, I don't find it necessary to talk to people to satisfy the extrovertness.  I just enjoy being around and sometimes observing people and their interactions with each other.  I'm no life of the party.  I just host them.

"ESFJ	IF you read my post thoroughly", the only generalization I made were:THEY talk too much, THEY blabber too much," all the others are in singular form...comprendes?MBTI talks about the ""dangerous ESFJ""..and I speculate that that particular type could be the ""ideal psychopath/double-lifer""--charming yet deadly", a classic Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde!ESFJs who have not had the advantage of developing their own values by weighing them against a good external value system may develop very questionable values. In such cases, the ESFJ most often genuinely believes in the integrity of their skewed value system. They have no internal understanding of values to set them straight. In weighing their values against our society, they find plenty of support for whatever moral transgression they wish to justify. This type of ESFJ is a dangerous person indeed. Extraverted Feeling drives them to control and manipulate, and their lack of Intuition prevents them from seeing the big picture. They're usually quite popular and good with people, and good at manipulating them. Unlike their ENFJ cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them understand the real consequences of their actions.They are driven to manipulate other to achieve their own ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of conduct.http://www.personalitypage.com/ESFJ.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	I literally went through this whole chat", there are a lot of things I personally don't connect with... For example I'm not a person who likes to share a whole lot.. A lot of times when someone asks me whats wrong, most of the time I'm not sure how I feel. It takes me awhile to open up to new people and speaking infront of people makes me panic a little. I always feel amazing after.. But I always have a nervous breakdown inside my head before speaking in public. I very much enjoy being around people and observing what people do or what they say. I usually do a good job analyzing it in my head but if someone asks me what I think I'm usually not very good at sharing. I get hurt a lot by friends and guys I date mostly bbecause I expect a lot and I'm somewhat naieve about the world and how things are. It's super hard for me to hear bad things about people and it usually effects me pretty deeply. When people are sad around me I feel very bad and when I'm around happy people I'm happy. I usually panic when I don't have things planne out in advanced and when things don't operate smoothly I stress a lot. I care very deeply for people... Sometimes too deeply and I get hurt. At times I can be overly emotional and assume something too quickly and stress out about something that ends up being nothing. When people are mean, I just can't understand it.. And if they are mean to me I sometimes feel so hurt I try and hurt them back which ends up making me feel even more sad and then I seem crazy because I'm apologizing.. Lately I've been hurt so much by people and then I go back to them apologizing for this or that when THEY should be apologizing to me.. Why do we do that? I constantly am bending over backwards instead of standing up for myself. I let my guard down too quickly because I truly believe the best in people and most of the time I get hurt! Ahhhh the life of an ESFJ!!! I struggle very often with the thought of people not liking me and being upset with me.. I take it so personally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	20. People don't understand that you thrive in an atmosphere of praise and encouragement and wilt in a critical one", and that any criticism must be dolled out gently and with a large dose of encouragement because in reality, you're harder on yourself than they are.    Number 8 speaks for itself. Could not agree more. It's usually because we flash people with some sort of outgoing and receptive personality and appear to be very open immediately. This leads them to assume that our personality is primarily this outward mindless enthusiasm. In reality, we're so full of different things that it's impossible and unrealistic to express it all at once. In this way, we need to be 'opened up' for our true versatility to be known, just as an introvert may need to be drawn out. It takes time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Also", good point on 9. I think it's because SJs generally look back at the past (probably Si). For me, this has manifested itself as an obsessive (and almost melancholy) interest in history, ancient civilizations, and forgotten fragments of the past. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	20. That's exactly the way to put it; I am so hard on myself. Misunderstandings with people sometimes arise from my severity with my person and my work. Sometimes people think I'm being overly-critical about something (such as their suggestions for a course of action) when the judgement is wholly directed at myself", not them. I can forget to explain that appropriately sometimes. I have to accept that 'nothing is ever good enough' is productive for refining and perfecting, but not always a healthy mentality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	I think that ESFJ's have to be very aware of the power over people they truly do possess.... and not take it lightly. Obviously there are some that have used it for their own selfish gain", but all types have their downfall, and most people in real life would never criticize them as much as I've seen criticism here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Then again", this forum is empty (wind whistling by), so not enough to defend themselves because, if I'm right, they mostly have no patience with the internet, especially when in person relations could be happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Originally Posted by MollyGoRound   Haha. This thread has made me realize that I have a friend who is ESFJ. So", forgive me if I repeat, but here are a few:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When everyone loves you", even the people that you dislike and make fun of more than others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When you get grossed/weirded out by anything and everything... is being a picky eater common??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When people begin to return your meaningful/dramatic looks with wide-eyed suspense"," sometimes accompanied by ""WHAT?!?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When you're always asking people ""Did you notice such and such about so and so"" and they almost always say no...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When you constantly have devotees you have to let down gently; you literally just notice things about everyone", and enjoy people immensely in a totally platonic way that is truly rare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When you can make literally anyone laugh", feel appreciated and understood, and have their faith in humanity restored.    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Are you sure you know many ESFJs? Because yes", there are some very definite ESFJ qualities in here that are mixed with some that definitely are NOT. For example," ESFJs are usually too kind to make ""fun"" of people. Now we might tease them", but making fun is generally too cruel for us. I know of only one or two who actually make fun of people. Now talking about people behind their backs? Yes, that is definitely an abhorrent ESFJ problem. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	In my experience", we ESFJs aren't generally very popular because on the whole, people are uncomfortable around us. We make people uncomfortable for various reasons, but the majority of ESFJs that I know only have a very few close friends, and the rest are pretty surface relationships. People are attracted to us at first, but in my experience," soon drift away because most of us ""cut to the chase"" too quickly on an emotional level. We demand too much emotional energy and commitment for most people. We're not generally good at small talk", we don't generally like anything, especially conversation, to remain on the surface level for very long, and we're not extremely quick thinkers nor are we generally quick-tongued because we experience everything on the emotional level and process our experiences and verbal exchanges through an emotional filter, which takes a lot of time to do. And although we really do enjoy people, we don't understand them very well, because most people will cut off their relationship with us before we have the opportunity to learn very much about them. Again, we delve too deep, too quickly, which makes more people than not, very uncomfortable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	And I've never known an ESFJ to be a ""picky eater"". We thrive on sensual experiences", including new tastes and textures. We are generally the ones who love to travel and experience new cultures along with new foods. And as far as the internet goes, I must be the exception to this rule, because I love the internet. That could be, however, because I'm a writer. I find that communication on the internet is much easier for me because it gives me time to think over what I want to say before I actually say it. I can think things through and think more slowly and thus express my thoughts more effectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	No", I don't know many ESFJ's-- just one, so I'm not pretending to have your type all figured out, I just thought I would join in the conversation so I could see what other ESFJ takes on what I said would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I noticed that someone else mentioned being grossed out by anything", and the person I know fits that, and it's why the picky eater thing is true for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	On the making fun thing", I think our misunderstanding is semantics. You say that making fun isn't something that would be done by an ESFJ, yet talking behind their backs would be.. this is kind of one and the same to me. Only, when this ESFJ gets really testy with someone, some of their interactions become more blatant (usually these people have been found to be judgemental, which messes with core values).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Insightful response", thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I answered you back earlier in a hurry because I can't stand to be misunderstood! I sincerely hope you or anyone else here doesn't take offense at anything I said", I'm just trying to figure out this type that is pretty different from my own, and I don't know a better way than going to the source! I'm a newbie to understanding other types that are different from my own, and I only have one friend that I am only mostly sure falls under this type. So that's the only reason I'm here, not to bash or be a know-it-all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I had a couple more thoughts in response to what you said.      Originally Posted by Nettl   ....For example"," ESFJs are usually too kind to make ""fun"" of people. Now we might tease them", but making fun is generally too cruel for us. I know of only one or two who actually make fun of people. Now talking about people behind their backs? Yes, that is definitely an abhorrent ESFJ problem.     Do you think it's at all possible that an ESFJ's good natured teasing with its persistent and 'on the mark' nature could be interpreted by a sensitive INFP as being made fun of? Maybe someone could witness how you talk about others behind their backs, come to the conclusion that you treat me the same way, and if that's true, then maybe you're actually making fun of me to my face all of the time? One thing I've read is that this type often doesn't realize the impact of their actions on others, so while the intent may be harmless or even affectionate, maybe that doesn't always translate--- sometimes I just feel picked on, especially because of the incessant nature of it all, and the apparent enjoyment of my discomfort (which I understand now is just playful.... I still don't quite get it).      Originally Posted by Nettl   .... we ESFJs aren't generally very popular because on the whole, people are uncomfortable around us.

Again, we delve too deep, too quickly, which makes more people than not, very uncomfortable.    Really? Do you really think this is all true about you and your type? I think that's so sad! Because I really enjoy this type of person, even if they make me uncomfortable sometimes. They're wildly creative and thrilling," they see the world much like I do. As an ""I"" there are few people that I trust instantly", and I get the feeling that ESFJ's are one of the few that I instantly like and trust and recognize as a kindred spirit. Even if they constantly tease, it's all good natured and how they show their enjoyment of people. They are non-judgemental for the most part, and it bothers them to see injustices, they take care of the underdogs everywhere.  I tend to have very few close friends, but I don't see it as a negative thing, I just invest intensely in people and only have so much to go around. I always assume it's something similar with others in similar situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	If you say you don't understand people well", how is it that MBTI seems to think that this type has so much ability to manipulate others? It seems that would be tricky if you don't understand them at all. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I find a lot of the things you mentioned endearing differences", not a reason to not form a friendship with someone. The way you process everything through emotions makes so much sense, because the person I know is that way-- it must be hard to struggle with feeling like you answer slowly," but it's actually because you have a lot to sort through internally and most people don't see it or recognize it for what it is.       Originally Posted by Nettl   And I've never known an ESFJ to be a ""picky eater"". We thrive on sensual experiences", including new tastes and textures. We are generally the ones who love to travel and experience new cultures along with new foods.    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Well", are those who are so sensitive to sensual experiences maybe vulnerable to being overstimulated early on in a way that traumatizes them? He definitely loves to travel and new experiences in every other way possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Whatever the case", whether my friend fits this or not (although overwhelmingly, I would say yes) I know that not all of a person is summed up by MBTI, and there are a lot of differences in any given type. Things like culture, upbringing, learning disabilities, coping skills making up for weaknesses in very different situations, all of these things cause very different outcomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	So", I am definitely not challenging your understanding of the type, yourself, or MBTI-- just a curious INFP who cares and wants to get to the bottom of this type having such undeserved infamy and flack. Because I think you guys are pretty great! :) (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],"id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s)","p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j",p);}})(window,document,script,ld-ajs);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I agree with many of those points", but some I don't quite relate to personally. Even so," a variation in the same type is always interesting.      Originally Posted by Nettl   ESFJs are usually too kind to make ""fun"" of people. Now we might tease them", but making fun is generally too cruel for us. I know of only one or two who actually make fun of people. Now talking about people behind their backs? Yes, that is definitely an abhorrent ESFJ problem.    I would say that I sometimes criticize people a little too harshly, but despite what I say my intentions are never to actually hurt people. However, it is inevitable when you're engaging in that behavior. I can sometimes not realize the extent to which teasing might affect someone because my intentions are always to make the other laugh or liven the mood, but as soon as this becomes known to me, I automatically feel awful because I never meant to hurt them in any way. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Any criticisms I direct at people I don't know are usually objective in a way. I may be laughing at their poor taste in clothing or bizarre hairdo", but I'm always aware that this does not define the person, and usually expect that people will change my mind if I talk to them. I do not ever consider any fun I pick at people to be a definition of them. It's just easier to make fun of people when you don't know them (something I dislike about myself). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Talking about people behind their backs is definitely a problem I've been trying to control. It almost seems unconscious", and I really do hate that I do it. I like to discuss people with other people and maybe come to conclusions about their character. This probably has a lot to do with both living in the external world and noticing much about people and needing to share it or verify it with another external source.

"ESFJ	I think we make people uncomfortable because we give them undivided attention", and can easily overwhelm or annoy them with our hyper-focusing. We also hunt people like heat-seeking missiles; no one wants to feel like they're under the radar all the time, especially introverts. We can also be a bit invasive and excessively outgoing at times, which can be equally overwhelming. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	We have surface relationships because we dive into people much too quickly", get bored, then slip away. Sometimes it's because we don't realize that we distance ourselves until we run into the person again, during which we act as if nothing has changed and welcome them back, and even convince them that we missed them terribly. We distance ourselves because these relationships mean nothing to us; we don't actually feel close to that person because we aren't. People are our priority, but the mystery in people we don't know is ever-tempting. Once we satisfy that curiosity, they can become rather uninteresting and we jump to the next stimulus. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Also", we think more about shaping ourselves around other people and the idea of being a good 'friend' to them, completely forgetting the importance of authenticity in forming long-standing relationships. And this is because we understand people so well. We are able to know things about them very quickly, and then decide quickly how we feel about them. I think the problem isn't  lack of understanding, but a lack of truthfulness. We care more about being pleasant and liked than being actually close to people, which will lead to our general dissatisfaction with our personal relationships. Our understanding of people is usually unspoken, because it's something we've become used to, and sometimes use as a tool for manipulation (bad trait #3). It's also an extremely difficult thing to explain. Usually we're too busy taking action in response to what we sense about a person, rather than pointing it out. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	On a side note: personally", I'm a bit too quick-tongued. Sometimes I'll speak before I've actually thought about what I've said. It's as if my Fe takes over on auto-pilot and spits out some socially acceptable dull response, making small talk too easy (and very boring). This is something I'm not fond of. This kind of idle speech hardly reflects my true thoughts, but usually does well to keep the other entertained or brighten the atmosphere. I'm also a fairly quick thinker, especially in group situations. Some of my best ideas are rather spontaneous, and instead the trouble usually lies within keeping the thought fresh before it slips away. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Originally Posted by SupernumeraryRainbow   Yep! Maybe not all ESFJ's can do it", but I know it's pretty easy for me. For example, I was talking with someone the other day about bowling and the conversation went something like this:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	""We should go bowling again.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Me: ""Yeah! That would be fun.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Although it can be cool to have such a excellent memory"," you often have a lot of trouble comprehending those ""abstract"" ideas (like gravitational time dilation - I think it will forever boggle my mind :). It's also important you use your memory when it's useful"," but don't ""show off"" just to impress people. I'm sure that could be really annoying.    I personally think it's great and I never see it as ""showing off"" because to the fact that it's considered personal to me. It's like they (well", some personal accurate people I know, anyways...) remember even the littlest details and it makes me feel really special! So, I really don't understand why people would get upset at that... but there is something to say for needless pedantic at arguments... there's accuracy, but then there's pedanticism (it's not really an ism word, but I just made it up...) -- that's how people may get upset, IMHO. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I don't even understand gravitation time dilation", so you've lost me there! I do, however, can take things between the lines and imagine things easily. :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	BTW", I think journaling is awesome! It's too bad there isn't more people that do it.    Ah, yeah. I also get lonely easily... all I can say is self employment was interesting, but I really need a partner in crime. I liked running my own thing (and actually organized it well -- you'll be shocked! If it's really important paperwork, chances are it's filed away... but that also what happens when you're raised by a strict father...),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm also a split on the E and the I... more E than I. Most people would place me firmly in the E from surface and interactions in public. Rare that I'm actually shy to people (but it does happen", and for obvious reasons... unfortunately). I was also seen more as a J to someone of my instructors in school since I was so steadfast with my work and somewhat organized... heh, very far off on that one. N is solid, F is also solid... although I can program and know how to do formal logic (I really don't know :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	#2 is very... hard to talk about. Definitely if it's someone I admire because I like replaying the feelings of what I felt and the looks and the body language.

"ESFJ	Sorry everyone", I realize I am yet another non-ESFJ posting on this thread, but I just can't understand why there is so much negative connotations toward the personality type. One of my very best guy friends is an ESFJ, and by that I mean he could be the poster child for the personality type. He is the friendliest, most charismatic, most gregarious, generous, loving, genuine, self-sacrificing soul I know. He will sacrifice almost anything for others, even those he does not know well, but especially for those close to him, most of all family. He has said to me many times," ""people are more important than anything else. Ever. People are always most important."" He uses this argument to rationalize staying up until 5 AM the night before exams and early classes time and time again", just to spend time talking to friends who need him. More often than not, when I see him he mentions how little sleep he got (usually 3-4 hours), and I ask him why he got so little, and the answer is always that he was spending time with friends or family. Sometimes I worry about him because he neglects his own health so often for the sake of others. I don't see how such unconditional love could be construed as negative (except perhaps for the ESFJ himself when he does things for others that drain him and his health).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I keep hearing people describing the ESFJ's as shallow. I wonder"," how many of those people really know an ESFJ beyond a casual acquaintance? I know my ESFJ friend very very well. Others in our large group of acquaintances/friends only know him as the ""class clown"" or the goofball", the life of the party. That is how he presents himself to people, trying to please and entertain everyone, and he succeeds in that, and some people would think he is shallow because of that, but that is only the surface of who he is. Having gotten to know him so well, I know that there is another side to him that he does not show to everyone. He likes to think to himself and he takes serious matters very seriously. He was depressed in middle school, and he consciously made the decision in high school to change his life, and taught himself to stop worrying so much what others think of him and to live his life so optimistically and for other people that he honestly now is a truly happy person. Anyone who can change his or her attitude on the world like that, through sheer force of will, can't really be shallow," can they? Are there any other of you ESFJ's who have had a similar experience? The thing with my friend is that he doesn't want people to know his past or that he used to struggle with depression. He asked me specifically not to tell anyone else we know about his experiences. He said ""people just see the happy-go-lucky me", and it's a lot easier when people just see that side of me, it's easier to make people happy," so can you just not tell anyone about any of this?"" I find it really interesting that he is the furthest thing from a shallow human being (he is the best listener", and honestly and deeply cares about the people he talks to, and does not take serious matters lightly at all), but he wants people only to see the bubbly," happy side of him because it's ""easier."" Are all ESFJ's that way? I mean", of course there are legitimately shallow people in the world, but this ESFJ is not one of them, and I suspect most are deeper than they seem on the surface.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	To be honest", I think ESFJ's are what this world needs. We need more people who genuinely care about the people around them and are charismatic enough and friendly enough to help and make people feel better about themselves. The only negative side of my relationship with my ESFJ friend is that I tend to live more in the past and get attached more strongly to things," while he lives for the present and ""blooms where he is planted."" I have a small", close circle of friends while he considers everyone to be his friend. This isn't usually a problem (I enjoy how friendly he is with everyone; it draws me out of the introverted bubble I would otherwise be in, even though I do actually like people), except that I am now living approximately 1600 miles away from him, and while I rely on consistent communication to feel like I really have a healthy friendship, he doesn't need that communication the same way I do. He expects to come back in a year or two and find his relationships the way he left them, while I have very little faith in such an optimistic outcome without the effort of constant communication in the interim. Regardless, he is one of the most reliable friends I have. I always know I can count on him. I just wish he would remember that he can count on me too, and let me do things for him.. he is always helping me and he hardly gives me a chance to return the favor! Every time I try, he always somehow twists the situation around and talks a bunch and smiles at me until somehow he's talked me into letting him do stuff for me instead. It's so aggravating in the most adorable way! :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I don't know that my insights are much help to anyone", as I myself am not an ESFJ, but I see them in a very very positive light, and I even wish I could be as genuine and generous and charismatic as these fantastic people are. The few I know (there aren't many, but they stand out) are absolutely amazing. I just don't understand why the term ESFJ has so many negative connotations on here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	I can't agree more with the "" Care about others even though the person has done wrong to them."" I have a couple friends who are ESFJ's and they both do the exact same thing. My two close friends who are both NFs have absolutely no problem being subtle about how they feel about one of them in particular", basically implying they think he has a low level of intelligence and that they really don't have much to say, even though he's not as dumb as he appears and definitely picks up on a lot of it. He also really desires to become closer to our little group of friends. I always want to at least socialize with him at least a little out of school to be nice, but fuuuuuuuuck, he seriously has nothing good to talk about. And this all coming from a sensor. You can now imagine how annoying it is to my NF friends, who also believe it is completely in their right to ignore and avoid anyone they don't like or appreciate. This of course always leads to them telling him we met up and had some fun without him, which visibly really hurts him. Despite this being a nearly monthly occurrence of his finding out we once again didn't invite him to something fun, he still talks to us as if nothing happened. I like my friends a lot, but they can be total assholes to others sometimes, makes me wonder why they even enjoy my company. Long story short, ESFJs are very nice and tolerating people, but me and them just don't mix. I also have such a deep empathy for their energy level, it really helps them out in school and real life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	So I feel your pain :) *hugs*    Right here is a perfect example of the misinterpretation of the actions of Thinking types", specifically the INTP. I have direct experience from your point of view because one of my long time best friends is an INFJ, he was also my roommate. When we INtP's debate, or question something (which is all the time. If we aren't verbalizing it, we're doing it constantly in our heads, which is why we're quiet and observe all the time.), we are just looking for a truth, a better understanding of the world than we have had previously. We have a neutral stance until the facts say otherwise with no emotional involvement. We are not judging you as a person, it is not a personal attack," and are not trying to be right.

"ESFJ	I'm answering to each of the bold sentences in sequential order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	1) Yeah", I falsely assumed you were talking about an INTP since we are on the most extreme side of the intellect spectrum. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	2) You will see this in a young INTP who is not aware of his/her personality type. We will think we're the smartest ever and aren't wrong and will make up something to defend our point (producing the image we are logical and rational). It is not until around high school that starts to go away. We like to make sure everything we have to say makes sense  before we speak. We value personal intelligence and competence very highly. We won't usually speak unless we have some experience/expertise in the area of interest. When we do", we go all out in depth. You will probably see us take awhile before we respond and once we do, you might think of it as random because you have already forgotten about the conversation, lol. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	3) Yeah", you can't just wave a logic flag all the time. Other types of intellects will have sensing and/or feeling in their personality types. Pure logic and pure emotion do not mix well and other contradict the other. Also, pure emotion and pure logic by themselves aren't efficient. One must learn to have a balanced ratio of both to be a well rounded, enlightened person. The struggle for us INTP's and possibly for other intellect types is that we need to learn to incorporate emotion into our decision making because we lack the understanding of it. It takes time and experience for the maturation and learning to occur. Life becomes much more enjoyable and easier once one learns this concept and improves at it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	You seem quite reasonable which I appreciate. This is probably because of your understanding and experience with INTP's due to much exposure (We're very complex creatures", but with simple needs).

We will think we're the smartest ever and aren't wrong and will make up something to defend our point (producing the image we are logical and rational). It is not until around high school that starts to go away. We like to make sure everything we have to say makes sense  before we speak. We value personal intelligence and competence very highly. We won't usually speak unless we have some experience/expertise in the area of interest. When we do", we go all out in depth. You will probably see us take awhile before we respond and once we do, you might think of it as random because you have already forgotten about the conversation, lol. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	3) Yeah", you can't just wave a logic flag all the time. Other types of intellects will have sensing and/or feeling in their personality types. Pure logic and pure emotion do not mix well and other contradict the other. Also, pure emotion and pure logic by themselves aren't efficient. One must learn to have a balanced ratio of both to be a well rounded, enlightened person. The struggle for us INTP's and possibly for other intellect types is that we need to learn to incorporate emotion into our decision making because we lack the understanding of it. It takes time and experience for the maturation and learning to occur. Life becomes much more enjoyable and easier once one learns this concept and improves at it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	You seem quite reasonable which I appreciate. This is probably because of your understanding and experience with INTP's due to much exposure (We're very complex creatures", but with simple needs). I've never encountered an INFJ girl though which is new.    1) Yeah INTPs and INTJs, and correct me if I'm wrong, are usually associated with the extreme ends of the intellectual spectrum. :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	2", 3)Yea! What you described was exactly what the other type that made me angry do LOL. They just started nitpicking on unimportant facts in the argument such as a typo I made (writing 'your' instead of you're) and started a whole argument over that! Then proceeded to 'teach' me how to use your and you're like how a primary school teacher would teach an year 3 child. While completely missing the whole point of the argument. I asked them to please stick to the overall argument and don't get sidetracked by picking out these little flaws, which made the proceed to call me a 'hot mess'. LOL the whole thing was very humorous tbh. and when I asked her to explain why she was making the accusations she was making, she didn't provide any logical explanations," all I got was a quote from a whole paragraph I have written and a line saying ""You just came across that way"". I didn't even know how to argue with someone like that", until I realized I wasn't the one being illogical, it was her. LOL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Ti is an INFJs tertiary function so when we need to utilize logic", I believe a well rounded INFJ is perfectly capable of that :) And I don't believe its just cause of my exposure to INTPs IRL, I think you guys are very easy to talk to in general because you are open minded, actually logical, and back up every point you make. Even if there is something I'm trying to say regarding feelings that would be hard to grasp, I find that there is an intuitive understanding at least so that also makes communication easier :) maybe I'm biased but INTPs are one of my favorite types haha both IRL and on PerC (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],"id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s)","p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j",p);}})(window,document,script,ld-ajs);,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Originally Posted by rd93   Yes I have such an issue with this. I like to be straightforward and bold about my opinions sometimes", but I worry about how another person could take opposition personally, especially when I can read it easily on their face. Not that I think some xxTxs have an issue with this," but I hate being told ""calm down"" or ""stop being dramatic"" when I am doing completely the opposite. What actually gets me riled up and emotionally flustered is when they use that phrase specifically", it gets under my skin. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Also", a lot of people doubt my credibility intellectually when they know my type (MBTI aware people), but before they know it," many assume I'm a rational. It's like they hunt for a weakness from the title of ""F"" let alone ""ESFJ""", and after that any little flaw will do to discredit me. Not reasonable judgment in my opinion.    Oh yes I know exactly how you feel about those phrases. Some people just need to understand that the F in our mbti basically means the things we care about are usually emotional related instead of physical or intellectual. But that doesn't mean we're all 'hot messes' that are easily wounded. A well rounded person should have a healthy mixture of feelings and thinking, and only then can we produce reasonable arguments. An extreme T would just be blunt and straight out without considering whether they've offended anyone or crossed the line," which is going to make their arguments come across as 'arrogant'. I was actually trying to explain this to the person I was debating with and she responded with something like ""don't get all emotional"," I'm just telling you the OBJECTIVE truth."" and no matter what I said", she wouldn't understand that I was just annoyed at her arrogance and attitude, it had NOTHING to do with my FEELINGS. I especially hate when they assume they're all OBJECTIVE... no one is purely objective, if you're giving me you're opinion, that is your SUBJECTIVE point of view. In my case, our argument was about her pointing out a flaw in my character that I didn't believe was true, but she labelled this personal opinion of hers as 'objective', so therefore every explanation I made was somehow me being 'emotional' and 'subjective'. I can't describe to you how unreasonable and stubborn she sounded.. it was painful to watch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mom is an ESFJ too, and it may often feel that way, but she's a really caring individual and I know she loves me and my siblings very much. If anything I think she's trying to...give some of her own input and try and give us something she feels we need in the moment, and bring us up better. Sometimes it's her way of trying to show us something we might have missed; she's opinionated and doesn't have the intention of hurting anyone however. It's hard for me to word it correctly right now, but to me it feels that it's her way of showing you matter more. At times she can be kind of tough love in regards to it seeming as though she's nicer to strangers. She struggles with the positions of having us be more independent, or being actively involved as a caretaker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	I went over to my ESFJ aunt's house for dinner.

We finished it off, then we went out for ice cream (my treat!), and altogether we spent 6 hours together, talking the whole time, and I was still sad to have to leave! Later this week: to the theatre to see the movie we both want to see and then out for Mexican food!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	My cousin in another state just got married this weekend", and her brother, an ESFJ, who I haven't seen in a few years, messaged me and said he missed seeing me there! We're sort of distant cousins and we haven't had much contact over the years but we're all the same age and have tons in common and I fit in with their family more than any other family I'm related to, and he's always gone out of his way to make and maintain a connection with me as if I were their long-lost sibling.

He got telling me something about something or other and to illustrate his point he started to say ""you remember at the festival this summer . . .""", paused," and he (not I) said ""oh", you weren't at the festival," you were at home in the US"". I was really impressed", because everybody who's anybody in our circle was at that festival, and most men I know who regularly encounter as many people as he does (I mean by the dozens and hundreds) do not remember who was what or where. He also remembered my name from the first time I met him and when introducing a small group of us to some other people at a later time he didn't even hesitate to recall my name.

"ESFJ	Most of the above describe my sister. She's the most giving", the most caring person I have ever known...so caring she makes me uncomfortable. Many times she has brushed my hair, patted it in place, washed my dishes, cooked me dinner...and she never have a need I can fulfill. BTW, she does this for all the family members, friends even strangers! I particularly like her detail planning skills especially when I'm planning for a trip...while I'm there in the clouds with this monstrous plan, spinning months even years into the future, she's busy taking care of my every detail in the present...and all this when she herself is time constrained with her family and budding career. Recently though she declared that she was tired of doing good to ungrateful people...and sure thing she has changed significantly. Not that I miss her taking care of me...I always wished she could stop pampering me. The problem is she's not the happy sister I used to know. Now she's obsessed with these grand schemes of becoming super rich, always cranky, too critical (not that I care with this but she has made my ESFP sister cry a number of times)...Is this normal with ESFJs? I mean does it reach a point you just withdraw from the very people you cared for, even do deliberate stuff that you know can hurt them? Damn I could be wrong but I get this idea that my sister is jealous of the siblings she imagine are doing better than her. I really adore her (one of the very few) and would like to understand her. Any ESFJ...anyone?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I think your sister is probably tired of trying to get the love and affection of everyone and not being appreciated for it. The thing about ESFJs is that when we do something we expect something in return (I know it sounds selfish). By something we do not mean the same act done for us", but rather love. Any act that shows love, it may be so small but it would mean the world to us to see that the other person cares. If we realize that they don't and if we close off completely we end up being that (critical, etc). I have a very bad habit of being like that with my younger sister, we just don't get along.

"ESFJ	-eve    It sure helped eve91", thanks. I now see how important appreciation is for ESFJs. I must admit though it's a bit confusing because I used to try to do something in return for her efforts but she always made me think like she didn't want anything from me. I guess the two of us being so different must have made me miss the cues on what she would have really appreciated. After all my idea of a gift or appreciation might be completely alien or even off-putting to my sister...got to understand what she really might appreciate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	It sounds like she just wants people to show that they care/love her back. Maybe you should make it a habit to ask her about her day and how she feels about it (not the easiest thing for a INTJ", i know) Once she starts talking you'll get to the deeper stuff, and even if you don't, it might do her good if you show that you care about her feelings and worry about her (what you obviously do, otherwise you wouldn't have posted this.)

Every single day I go through copious amounts of INTP profiles, knowing that none of them are INTP just by profile picture and wishing I could just tell them without that backlash. People don't like SJ's because the people who type themselves as SJ's are incredibly SJ-ish.    Intps can have any profile pic they want, and still easily be an intp. Not every intp has to have an avvie of a math symbol  As others have said here, it's as simple as there being more intps interested in MBTI compared to esfjs. (Edit - also cause intps tend to be very misunderstood in reality, so once they finally feel understood for once...well I'd imagine it to become wildly interesting to anyone in that context),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being married to an INTP, I completely understand how these miscommunications happen but I've also seen how these can be mitigated in the future and resolved in a respectful way to each personality type. There is no one best personality type and I would venture to speculate that there is no one type that is the most difficult to talk to (objectively) if you remove your own personality bias / lens with which you see the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Regarding your close friend"," I'm sure if you wrote down some of the conflicts we could help you see where the breakdown happened. ESFJs biggest strength is Extroverted Feeling and our biggest weakness is Introverted Thinking. So if you approach a conflict with your ESFJ friend from only a pure logic (in the T sense of the word) then you're trying to tap into their weakest function in their moment of stress. Sometimes I think T types can equate feelings = weakness / irrationality and logic = rightness and I don't think that that helps in these situations or that it's fair to Feeler types. Perhaps next time when a miscommunication happens see if you can try to tap into the feelings side more and instead of saying something like ""I don't get why you're so mad. That's clearly not what I was saying when I said xyz (**insert cold hard facts**)"".... instead you might get further if you say something like ""I can tell that this really hurt your feelings. I'm really sorry if something I said upset you. Why don't we talk it out a bit to figure this out.""

Like any communication with personality types that are different than you (especially T & F) it requires you to go out of your comfort zone and see things from someone else's perspectives instead of trying to bring your own logic to the table. Next time ask yourself: Where is this miscommunication coming from? What is my role in it? Was I (inadvertently) trying to crush feelings with logic?

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by haephestia   It manifests a lot more in ESJs than I think other types (mostly NTs) would ever care to admit. We're able to apply a lot of weird situational information to get the job done.

I walk into the room," go 'wtf why..."" and Ne takes over"," gearing up with Te to say ""well it must be because of this... or because this is a better arrangement... well this looks like the supply room on the 3rd floor now!"" and Ta-daa dissonance solved.

"ESTJ			   Hell yes I do. I used to be a voracious reader", I'd go through a novel or two a week year round when I was in grade school right through to my second or third year of college. Now that I'm finishing my 7th consecutive year of post-secondary ed (lol kill me please) and am in a really heavy program, I don't get to read as much as I used to. But I read on the treadmill and listen to audiobooks when I get the chance, so that helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Now I read a lot more dystopian future/alternate reality stuff", more 'realistic fantasy' I guess. The market's pretty much flooded with it at the moment and one of my novels is a dystopian fantasy. Otherwise I just finished reading Graceling and it's prequel and really enjoyed them, but I think even more than fantasy/AU I'm more and more hooked on historical fiction. Lisa See is one of my favourite authors, there's a series called 'The Luxe' that I really liked... there's been a bunch more too but I'm too lazy to go through my goodreads list to remember XD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	As far as STJ", from gut reactions we would prefer to do the details or implement it.

"ESTJ	One point of nuance: I'm not asking to form stereotypes", and I apologize if I come off that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1. Are there common situations that ESTJs excel or struggle with? For  example", high school is generally not a fun time for INFPs.Excel with: I don't have much problem at school, always among Top 10 in class, always chosen as class administrator, joined lots of clubs, had decent friends. I was a responsible child, my parents trusted me more than my older brother. I took care of household when they were at work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Struggle: Because I'm a responsible person and never complain", my friends, siblings, teachers, and parents dropped most of the heavy burden and responsibility on my shoulder. They didn't care about my feelings because they think I can handle everything. But actually I was very upset because I feel used, exploited, and abandoned. Maybe that is why I have a lot of anger. I was very fiery and everybody was afraid of me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2. Do you find common interests among ESTJs on this site? Is that just a coincidence? Sometimes yes", sometimes not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3. Easiest way to commit a faux pas to an ESTJ in conversation or action? Easiest way to show understanding?I'm human", treat me like a human. Just because I don't cry, doesn't mean I'm not sad. Just because I act cruel, doesn't mean I cannot empathize. Just because I don't show it, doesn't mean I don't have feelings. I do feel, but I have priorities other than following my emotional drive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I liked the video", personally! One of the better descriptions of our type I've ever seen.

"ESTJ	@WickedQueen  ", I excelled in school and still do. Academic settings suit me for the most part, although I have to say now that I've been interacting directly with patients for so long, I don't think I could go back to a straight-up 'objective' job in health care. I did have many decent friends and still do, and while it's harder for me to make close friends now, I suspect that is more enneagram subtype than MBTI. I am perfectly capable of getting along with and working alongside most people in terms of MTBI leanings. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I struggle when it comes to 'empathizing with fools'", as well as 'social patience', according to my husband.

"ESTJ	My room sometimes looks like a bomb detonated there", but I still know, where eyerything is most of the time. However, when it comes to homework, tests and exams, I absolutely hate not knowing when I have to finish something or what I have to learn. One of the most frustrating things for me is, when I missed class and nobody is able to tell me what I have to do for homework. I have a book diary which I use to keep track of almost everything I have to do and when I have to finish it. Usually, I just do the smaller tasks on the day before they are due and everything bigger about three days earlier. I usually seperate bigger projects into small parts and set my own time, when I want to have each of them finished. Sometimes, especially on weekends, I lose track of what I have to do, so I start making detailed lists ^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I'm wondering if I can be one of you guys and Te seems like a good fit", but its extraverted nature in dominant position puts me off a bit.    I'm not extraverted by 'layman's terms' and I can't say I've met an ESTJ who is. I can very much appear extraverted when I'm at work- you have to communicate to succeed at your tasks and be effective, and the joking around and helping people is just good for morale and building relationships with people! I enjoy working with others over working alone most of the time... like I'd rather work on a solitary task in the presence of others than work on it totally isolated, but there are exceptions too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I get burnt out spending too much time with people. I'm not much of one for initiating hanging out with others", but if I'm invited to something I'll usually go and have a great time. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	My social life tends to be pretty segregated too", like I've got friends I hang out with in groups because it's fun and we can party, then I have the friends I hang out with one on one or maybe 3 of us (who are usually my closer friends), there's acquaintances... People I know through organizations I'm a member or volunteer with that I only see there, classmates (99% of them I don't hang out with outside of school) and workmates (same deal). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Among the people I wouldn't hang out with outside of where we met", I can apparently appear pretty reserved and uninterested in forming stronger relationships... it's not intentional, but it pretty much is how I feel so I guess that works out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Regardless", don't let the E in Te put you off. The dominant function being externally focused has no bearing on your social orientation in function theory. They are related for plenty of people, but it's not a rule they be the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I'm wondering if I can be one of you guys and Te seems like a good fit", but its extraverted nature in dominant position puts me off a bit.    I do prefer to be with people, as much as possible, but I'm not that outgoing. Especially with strangers, I'm not talkative at all, and I can never think of anything to talk about, but I do get energized among other people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	As haephestia said", don't let the E take you away. Being an E is all about which is your dominant function.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	If I'm having a bad day", I usually want one of two things. Either I want to talk about it, even though sometimes it takes some lingering to make me talk about what troubles me. If that's not the case, I want to do something I enjoy with people I enjoy. It's often hard to tell which though (I think). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by kirkland   How do you console an ESTJ having a bad day?    When I'm having a bad day", I try not to show it too much. I keep smiling and being happy as usual, however I'm extremely vulnerable to stupidity and unproductivity. I usually try to keep my cool, but if someone asks the same questions all over again or doesn't do, what he was supposed to, I react pretty angry and sometime even yell at people, if they don't notice, how important what they are doing (or in this case not doing) is for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	That also happens sometimes", when I'm really stressed and someone is exhausting my nerves. There are a lot of warn signals, but some people just seem to ignore them.

I mean i do want to get along with you guys honestly so i want to know what to avoid and what to not avoid. I mean i follow with Fi and so everything I do must coincide with how I feel. Hmmm when you do feel responsible for them do you explain why its important that they know instead of like getting mad at them or judging them? Cuz INTJs do this like tell me what im doing wrong or this is wrong then dont elaborate on it so I get super mad about it. -___- I had to go to my ENFJ professor for explanation. I find I dont really have a lot of ESTJ or SJ friends actually. It might jsut be me", and thats fine too if our paths run in different directions and such but im odd and weird and I dont really follow the rule or norms. I think out loud, i talk to myself, im oblivious to when others hint things due to my ADHD and all but Im just not good with socializing either. I am compassionate and care about alot of people and to an extent what they think and thats just me. I may not agree with how others live and such and what they think as I will probably disagree but all in all, everyone has a purpose and path and I mean no one should say you are this and that when they themselves do not know. with any type its important to be open minded. And it really does all depend on the person. Like my mom and I had a discussion about me. She said in this world there are people who are the drones and just do what they are told or need to do without like consulting or really looking into it. And its needed its necessary but its not me and its not good for me. So what works for you wont work for me and vice versa. I just want you to trust me in what I say and not take it the wrong way since others on here have been..........closed minded. My advice is just advice and its just me being helpful and nice because well i care to a fault XP. So you can be open and trust me on that :3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Miyu   How can you tell the difference between ESTJs and ISTJs?    Ask yourself which one is more likely to run you over if you stand in their way. That's the ESTJ. ISTJs are much more cautious and self-doubting", and tend to far more passive. Three of my best friends are ISTJs- they're extremely organized, but they aren't much good at organizing other people. ESTJs motivate groups and organize projects, while ISTJs motivate themselves and organize themselves. As they grow older, many ISTJs do learn how to work with groups, but their natural preference is only a few people, while ESTJs like a much larger group to work with, and will often take a leadership role. I'm an ENTJ, and the ESTJs I know appear far more extraverted than I am. Last week my ESTJ friend and I went shopping, and she brought four of our other friends with us when I thought it would just be the two of us. ISTJs are far more likely to just go with the flow and follow along unless something is really wrong. They conserve their energy more.      Originally Posted by Whitewolf   Hi everyone!

"ESTJ	@TopCatLSD ", if he wants ^^    Man, I was a fuckin idiot when I was a kid. My parents used too worry about my health a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I was a baby still sleeping in the crib", my parents had given me my own room and put me right next to the window. Apparently I used to climb out of the crib and onto the window sill and stare outside, my parents found me dangling my feet out the window trying to escape (<thanks mom & dad) I did it so often that they eventually gave my room to my sis and made me sleep in their room so they could supervise me. When I was little I also had a habit of hiding in my house until my parents would cry cause they thought they lost me," then I'd burst out like ""SURPRISE BITCH!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I started going to school", I was constantly one of the most obnoxious kids in the class room. I was constantly making noise and trying to make my classmates laugh. My teachers hated me. Looking back I was probably a huge disappointment to me ESFJ dad, he always wanted us to be the most successful out of everyone in our peer group, but I would fail every academic subject and couldn't for my life concentrate in the classroom. I was also really possessive of girls I had crushes on (I think I still am, actually) if I saw any guy talking to them," I'd jump in and be like ""Uh"," no bitch! She's mine.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	My 12 year old life was probably the darkest point in my life. I was part of an underground fight club with me and my main group of friends. I was cool with the skater table", the black table, and the beaner table <well, the NOT as ghetto beaner table. (I'm hispanic, I can say that). We used to get like thirty people at a time to show up and watch our fights," it was so much fun. We used to plan fights like a day ahead of time and text out witch bathroom or hallway we where going to host it in. My job was to ""charm"" the campus supervisors into letting us go into the most empty parts of school"," I'd say ""We need to go to Mr.Whatshisfaces room"," we'll be quick"" or my favorite ""Oh campus supervisor #2 I almost didn't notice you got your hair done"," it looks nice!"" Cause there was so many of us", we had to brake into squads and use different paths to get their, my squad always had the easiest getting in. We also had a Youtube channel where we would post the fights, but it got taken down by the cops...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	After that was over I got to go home to my bipolar INFP mum whom I was living with; I'll spare the details. My parents where going through divorce", so all she could afford was a broken down piece of shit house with cockroaches and a falling roof. She would come home every night sobbing her eyes out, depressed. It was my responsibility to care for her emotionally. It felt like I was parenting her, and not the other way around. I legit feel sorry for any parents who have INFP kids, It's absolutely miserable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Since the start of highschool", I'm more open again and I made lots of friends. I also think that I can cope with emotions way better now ^^    Copy that, here we go. (I'm probably going to include some stuff after 12/13 as well, as it's relevant to the story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	For a starter", I wanted to know how everything worked. And I wanted to know the reason why I had to do stuff. (This one was important, though it didn't really work well with ESFJ mother). Say why I had to eat with both fork and knife, if I don't use the knife, why would I have to have it in my hand? Why do I have to take of my shoes when it's dry outside and they aren't dirty? Why can't I go outside with just socks if they don't get dirty? I wanted answers on all of those questions, and I wanted the answers to make sense," so it really frustrated me when I got the answer ""that's how you do it"" or answers similar to that. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Another problem that arose is rather connected to inferior Fi than Te", but still. The general thing is that I wasn't always considerate to how other people would perceive what I was saying, so they got hurt. Best example I can think of is ones when my sister had a new cap, and well, I didn't think it fit her. So I told her so. She took it badly, and yea. My mom tried to explain to me that I shouldn't do stuff like that, but I just told her what I thought as a matter of fact. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I didn't really have any problem in school", until I was about 11/12. Before that I enjoyed it, I was good at what we did, I learnt stuff (I've always wanted to learn interesting things, though I have a hard time putting down the energy and time if I don't enjoy it or find it useful, from when I was young 'til this day), and had lots of friends. After that though," we started having English as a ""real"" subject", (which didn't work out for me until maybe 14/15, where I went from lowest to among the highest grades)," and I ""noticed"" that I didn't really have any friends. Well", I had friends to hang out with in school, but I guess that's where my Fi went in and said that that wasn't enough," and I wanted ""more"" than just that. So during the latter half of elementary school", I went through without having any real friends. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Later (13/14", but relevant as I started developing my Te more here (I think)), I used to get in to a lot of fights with my mom, and looking at it from now, I see that it's mostly Te/Fe. (also just teenager/parent, but influenced by the functions) As I always wanted things to make sense, and she didn't give me a reason for things but still forced them upon me, it simply created friction. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I haven't had any problems with other kids in my age that I can think of. And Te wasn't that obvious either. Probably since I was raised in a very non-Te way by my ENFP dad and ESFJ mom. I was always taking the more submissive part in relations I entered", which I didn't always like, but that's how I worked at that time, so that's what I did. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I was between five and about 12", most of my spare time was spent outside, making swords of sticks and wood and bow and arrow, and then playing with those in a made-up world. Sometimes, I could even stop playing for half an hour or so, just to think of the back-story of who I was, the world around him, etc. I've always enjoyed making things myself, and have a couple of padded swords I made just half a year ago," for more ""realistic"" fighting. So I guess that interest has always been there", more or less. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Another thing I loved was Lego", and making things myself (not according to the design, but how I wanted it to be).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Another thing that might be of interest is that when I became old enough to start helping with cleaning the house and stuff", I pretty fast came to the conclusion that I had to have the responsibility for some part of it," as it didn't work when my parents said ""do this"," do that"". ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I think I was less typical Te than I am now", though it was there, hidden underneath. I just wasn't comfortable to expose it until I changed school (elementary school wasn't that good, and people weren't accepting of Te at all...),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I usually had heaps of new ideas as a kid and I also liked to show them to other people. I managed to get many introverts very excited when they were playing with me. Being alone was also fine for me", though. I always did some crazy things like creating my own vending machine that gives out marbles (as far as I remember, I got several things stuck in the radiator when doing this) and I mixed together every kind of soap and shampoo that I found," hoping that something cool would happen. I was also really energetic and happy at that time. My great-grandpa once told my grandma: ""This kid isn't able to walk normally."" She asked why he thought that and he responded: ""She takes two steps and every third one is a jump"" I remember that I was always very interested in science and my dad teached me how electricity works and gave me plugboards with all sorts of stuff to experiment with. I also had a book about it but I usually just tried my own stuff. (I also had a chemistry set and I tried to grow crystals for some time)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I hated my kindergarden because the people were boring and never let me do what I wanted. The girls weren't very nice although I had a few female friends and I just liked to play with some of the boys. Also", I frequently threw tantrums at that age because I was indecisive and someone forced me to decide. During elementary school, I had two very good friends and also got along with the rest of the class. Our school was a bit alternative and we were able to do whatever we wanted whenever we wanted as long as we finished everything until the end of the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I was at an after-school care club for one year and I totally hated it because of the same reasons", I hated kindergarden. I usually just played with an ENTJ girl who was pretty bossy and sometimes hard to cope with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The start of middle school wasn't hard for me in terms of school work but there was one girl that heavily bullied another girl. I was in a rather introverted phase but I still decided to call her out for it - I don't even know why... Then", that girl also tried to make me look bad which was just... kind of irritating but I didn't really care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	My parents got divorced when I was 13 or something and it really hurt me", although I didn't show it. For almost a year, I sucessfully hid it, just because I didn't want pity from anyone. In addition to that, my ENFJ mum wanted to make everything more structured and started to give me restrictions.(I was able to decide almost everything on my own before that and it worked) I fought a lot with her and I often got into even worse situations because it's hard to discuss with someone who isn't willing to listen to other opinions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Since the start of highschool", I'm more open again and I made lots of friends. I also think that I can cope with emotions way better now ^^    Reading this, it's a wonder how you ever managed to mistype as an ESTJ. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	That's all...    It takes a lot to share personal endeavors so a tip off to you. In terms of your mom", she seems unhealthy overall. If shes ESTJ then yes she is an unhealthy ESTJ. You being her daughter should over-turn any bias she holds in terms of how things should be; even if they bother her. She is not open minded, and this is not an ESTJ thing so don't worry on types.

I'm not sure how she would react and i think you already know and just need some comfort and courage on your future actions. Just stay strong, stay to your word, and stand up for yourself.

"ESTJ	Did the ESTJ typing come about before you started to open up again?    Well", a friend introduced me to MBTI with a very meh test that just gives you percentages. I got E(24%)N(38%)T(85%)J(12%) or something like that when I did it the first time. The ENTJ describtion didn't really fit me, though," so I did the test again and got 1% for sensing. I never really considered being a perciever since I tend to believe that I'm organized and pragmatic (while an INTJ has described me as ""the most impractical person he knows"".)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using emotions means to use them as tools to get things done. Using anger for ambition, sadness for determination, happiness for caring. Its a fuel for actions basically and not a show stopper. It also means using an emotion to get a job done.

I want to learn programming and get a math minor, but other than that, everything is wide open, because I honestly have no idea what I'm doing lol ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I actually do. I was really homesick when I got here and wasn't sure how I'd like the huge emphasis on tests", but I love the lack of busy work. I've been able to study before the day before for once in my life- and have actually had to, because there's so much information. I'm not as much a fan of the lecture only classes, and much prefer the discussions, but the material is really interesting. I have a good Spanish teacher too, which is especially nice because my high school teachers really didn't teach me anything. Overall, I spend a lot less time in class and a lot less time doing actual work, so as long as I make sure not to become a recluse, it works for me. I spend a lot of time in the common room so I can both be productive and get actual human contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I am very conscious of my body", but I've never associated it with Si...I associate it more with being a strong sp-dom (I'm jumping theories, I know). I guess I could see the function being body-oriented, since it's basically the sensory version of Ni. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ			   I am acutely aware of my physical self; I don't pay attention to it in the day-to-day", but it grabs my attention immediately when something is not right. I know exactly where my pains come from; I know if they are normal or abnormal. I know if they merit additional attention or if they can be ignored. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It can be difficult for me to ignore things like hunger. Even if I try to ignore it", the sensation is powerful and tends to be very distracting. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	That said", I am the first person to ignore pains if they're not serious and I have something on my plate that I care more about. I believe niss noted a statistic somewhere that said SJs are the types that often end up being killed off by physically-related issues later in life. We tend to ignore/put off physical problems for the sake of higher priority issues. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Basically", if the pain doesn't impede us from completing a goal, we'll ignore it until we have free time to deal with it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Why would that be the case?    Well INFJs tend to be more observant and open to who people", similar to INFPs. Difference is that they have a different method and way of understanding others. They have Fe as a second function so first they want to know all about who you are and piece the info together from what you tell them and what they observe. Then they will say what they agree or disagree with all while respecting you and not pushing you do things you are not in agreement with or are uncomfortable with; exploring you and their limits. My best friend is an INFJ and although my views with hers arent in alignment (as in how i should function and behave), she understands that my way and function isnt wrong but different and vice versa. We share the same or msot of the same values. I value independence, creativity, personal space, expressing emotions, and expressing opinions. What we disagree on is consideration of people, patience, chances and even listening. She merely says, well i dont agree with that i see it this way because I believe this, and im like okay; interesting. I mean she does say, i think you should do this because so and so to which im like no, i dont agree and shes like ok; she accepts it. If she gets cheeky and does the whole i say one thing when i mean another I do tell her to knock it off but its only sometimes. What im getting at is that INFJs tend to let you be you without pushing anything they think on you usually; and just let you be you while trying to understand you more; similar to INFPs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	No not type descriptions. I am basing it on keirsey", Isabel Myers writings and research from articles. I find socionics to be too confusing and it doesn't match up with Keirsey or MBTI so i don't reference or use it. Keirsey and MBTI connect with one another and branch from one another so its easier to follow and make connections. Keirsey states NFs have a definite goal, and its the search of identity; which is blatantly true. We all search for who we are and what our purpose is and that's our MAIN goal or should I say focus in life. Its our number one worry, who am I? Who am I really? Where do i fit in this world? What is my calling? I am who I am, never change me. If i lose who I am, then there is not point in living. Its always on our minds. I am not saying its the only type who thinks this, merely saying that's all that matters to NFs. Along with identity its how can i make peace in this world? Harmony, beauty, art, creativity, avante garde; that's our drive. I am speaking in general for this whole post btw. Now the differing methods comes from the functions, which in turn goes to approaches. For example, when meeting a total stranger, if I find the person is setting off alarms then i act cold and distant to the person; even before meeting them. My INFJ friend however will pick up the same vibes but with Fe, will be polite and kind so not as to hurt their feelings; despite the alarms she is feeling. Me, I don't care and that's where she will be bothered and then I get upset that she still acted like she did despite feeling something was off; because to me that's not being true to her feelings which greatly bothers me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	But as I said", I don't have much experience with xNFJs.    I think you may have and don't know it. They will be the most understanding and gentle in your life. But i guess if you havent then you havent.  Yeah i was thinking the extroversion and judging. Outgoing and organizing. Hmmmm how different is it? Like an example? I mean are you open to trying different and new methods of working? NFJs tend to push you to do better in your own way or improve you, as that is their focus and function. Its why they are called Counselors and Teachers. Thing is, sometimes they don't know when to stop pushing and that can be very irritating..... I find diplomacy is the key thing in NFs. Keirsey sees the NFJs as the mentors and the NFPs as the advocates; which makes sense and you just told me that Fi users tend to bring out the best in you. So NFJs are like, let me guide you to be a better you, let me help you improve and grow; let me guide you, and NFPs are, you are awesome just as you are, go for what you want and ideals and never forget to keep learning and growing. is this what you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	 In terms of function.....its relatable to keirsey in like you can explain HOW NFJs are the teachers and counselors and HOW NFPs are the champions and healers. Not the other way around.

Then you get people who divorce simply because they ""Weren't duals so there must be a better match out there"".    Already got the INFJ lecture on generalizations. I only speak to explain how MBTI works", not tell people who they are. I actually find MBTI useful for understanding others and how they think and work only; not tell them who they are. More so for respect. Like INFJ will appreciate my being more considerate when i am but smh at my not being so yet still think, thats just who she is and its good because its useful as much as what I think is. I am not speaking from mbti on INFJs, more so of personal experience as I have a lot of INFJs in my life. Not all act the same, but they do function very similarly; almost the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Dude once again", im just throwing a suggestion out there. Not here to discuss or debate or argue. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	oh okay well thats why i didnt find the descriptions acceptable. MBTI is about the FUNCTIONS of the type", not description. Keirsey branches off from functions and shows via behavior how they manifest. Thats what I am saying. I just told you why I think INFJs should or could be on here already. Whether you like or not okay. Accept it or not, okay. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I find Si to be....well since i have it", like if it works, then why change it? Its history up to now. Habits, thoughts, actions, behaviors etc. Its like building blocks, made a mistake remember it, do something different then stick to it. Its an internal system of how things are done, and depending on the person it could be values, work, thought processes, habits etc. Im missing something I think....cant recall.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I DID use the enter key you ninny! -___-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I said already like more than once", that I am speaking from general information! I am speaking in general! All im saying is this is the INFJ as a whole. Not all INFJs are the same. I just find them easy to identify. Actually its easy for me to identify any type and functions in people....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I am still not getting your point here. I already told you where you can find the whys and hows. If you mean people should look more into the MBTI and Keirsey and question why or how this works or how they did this", then yes i agree. I felt this was already obvious since......i mean its superficial and theres more info so why ignore it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, I try to be objective, so if I am responsible for something bad happening, I will take responsibility for that. If other people are at fault, I will let them know, but being an Enneagram 9 (very uncommon for any Te-dom), try to do so politely since I honestly fear conflict.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by ArmchairCommie   As an ISTJ I'm interested to know if ESTJs often blame their failures on others or on themselves?

If there's a group project, and we fail, there's always something I could've done better.

And while I might know it wasn't my fault, it's a way of improving to the next time. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I blame someone else than myself", it's usually a single individual. Unless the whole group actually failed, but then it's the individuals in the group. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	How do you experience tertiary Ne?    My favorite leisure activities would be wrestling", reading, learning about typology/asoiaf-theories/medieval weapons and military strategies, playing board games (strategy based) with friends, talking to friends, that kinda stuff. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	To relax", I usually read, or do something physical. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Free time is usually spent doing something of the leisure activities I mentioned", holidays are usually spent with family (). Still living home, so I can't do much about it.

"ESTJ	Tertiary Ne", that's a love-hate-relationship. About a year ago, I loved Ne with all my heart, as it can make me more light-hearted and such. But I stopped valuing that for several reasons, so now there are other reasons for why I like it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Ne makes sure I can look at things from about every angle", and makes me quick with possibilities, what ways different things can go, but can show in making me unsure of which route is the best, making me imagining all the worst possibilities of something, that kind of things.

"ESTJ	I relax by doing something that engages the physical senses and pulls me into the present moment. I am normally future-oriented", so it's refreshing to be distracted from it. I especially love things that appeal on a touch level. I have a habit of touching objects when I walk places (walls, windows, plants, fences, etc) in order to connect with the present and heighten the NOW experience. I really like textures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't think those things are because of the fact that we're perfectionistic, though we for sure are. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I understand that you want an answer from an ESTJ", and I'm sure someone will answer, but I just felt the urge to say something as well. If you don't want an INFP-opinion, just skip it. :) I hope the ESTJ's don't mind either as this is their thread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go via the parents seeing that she values their opinion strongly and want to do things 'the right way'. I can relate to that as my dad who is ESTJ (and Christian) would prefer to see relationships of his children happen with his consent or at least with some kind of involvement from him. Maybe she feels she let her parents down and herself as it went too fast. I'm not saying you should propose", but rather somehow make contact with them in some way that makes her feel more at ease with the situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	From what I can see with my dad", stress causes him to get very creative in pessimistic thinking: everything will be interpreted in the worst possible way. For example, our family bought lately, even though second hand, a very expensive vehicle. My brother arranged most of the deal and purchase, but was quite surprised when he paid a part in advance and learned that there was still an extra amount VAT to be paid. He concluded that he had misunderstood the dealer, especially when thinking afterwards of what the man had said. My father on the other hand (who had never talked with or seen the man), felt that the seller was trying to deceive us. When later on there seemed to be a problem with the brakes (because it had stood too long still), this idea was enforced and he was angry with my brother for not being more firm enough towards the seller. However, my brother who had made the contact with the dealer knew enough to trust the man and indeed, in the end, the seller paid for all the extra repairs without too much fuss. I'm not saying it's wrong to be cautious, but for my dad the worst possible interpretation was the reality and he was upset towards others for not seeing this. I'm sure not all ESTJ's are this way and I should add that he is also chronicly ill and therefore more prone to stress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	...    Protecting me (haha", from her father!) or protecting her values - thus distancing herself. Just a weird thought.

Constantly challenging someones view or value is extremely draining and unnecessary in our eyes. With Fi included, this can make us.......not be around you. We dont mind a challenge, constantly doing it is going over the line though. With inferior Fi, it can be hard to express this while someone like INFP or ISFP will express this immediately and just.......drop you. Values are not something to be logically explained; it just is and whoever doesnt like it has to deal with it. We can only explain why we value it, nothing more, nothing less. Ex: I value babies. Why? because they are cute, intelligent, full of potential, interesting, strong, adorable, and loving. When you love them, they give love in return and you know its genuine and your love will be returned. Thats it. That being said, goodluck trying to get an INFP, ISFP to share their values lol.

While the Fi dom has negative anxiety, little restlessness, but a kind of fear that they are not being their authentic selves when conducting themselves, or they may just be anxious because they are not authentic in order to seem socially fit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	So the question is kind of: how do you battle restlessness", when do you experience anxiety, and what are you afraid of.    For me personally:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Restlessness - This usually happens when I'm stuck in a group setting or having to converse with people that I cannot find common ground with (Ex: differing tastes in music that I have no idea about)-- it doesn't challenge me logically/intellectually so I become really restless. I just kind of let it be-- I allow myself just to be bored if I can't leave the situation or find someone else to converse with. If I'm alone", usually I'll find a friend to go do something with or do something that I enjoy alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Anxiety - As rare as it is", I recognize this happens when I feel like I do not have control over my emotions or something triggers a negative emotional response that I don't necessarily want to voice/talk about. But I've recognized this is just a part of life/feelings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I agree that ESTJs are direct. I agree that ESTJs are likely to be direct in relationships. I agree that ESTJs are unlikely to lie a lot in relationships", because they take them so seriously and are so god damned lawful (D&D alignment wise). That being said, not all ESTJs are great at expressing their feelings. ESTJs take forever to process their feelings, and only when they're done processing can they even attempt to articulate them. In the meantime, they may be very withdrawn and uncommunicative. That's our INFP shadow at play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	'Very moody'", 'takes pride of being a jerk', 'manipulative', as well as 'hot and cold' are NOT a type.

They are two different things, and you should not mix them up together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I have been dating an ESTJ guy for a couple of times. He recently has divorced because of his wife betrayal as he told me. However", I don't know the story in detail. Actually I would like to know more but he asked me to give some time and then he will explain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Well", as an ENFJ this was a little bit difficult relationship for me, actually too harsh ;) but he showed a lot of enthusiasm and I also liked him and had feelings for him so I continued. Then one day we had a heated up conversation on a topic he brought up which I felt insulted and reacted strictly and somehow emotionally that hurt him. To me it was not hurting. If he could have put himself in my shoes, he would have told me far worse! Anyway... a few hours later I apologized for making him upset. He responded nicely but again sent me a video which I found again disturbing. That brought the next round of fight but this time in a passive way! He called me and I did not respond as I was really mad of him. Next day I asked him to meet and resolve the issue but this time he said it would be better to give time and meet later. Meantime he had a trip to visit his family and when he came back again there was no sign of him. I told myself I will text him for the last time and if he does not reply I will let it go. This time he replied with delay but we met and resolved most of the issues that bothered both of us. In the end he told me that he would have liked to continue this relationship but right now he is looking for a new job position which is not sure yet. Also while visiting his parents, he had visited a psychologist who advised him to take a few more months of break as it is too early after his divorce to enter a new relationship. He highlighted the job issue for his reason but I personally think that the advice of the psychologist was more important to him as he said I don't want to make a mistake again. Finally he asked me to give him 4-5 month time to make things work. After that we were in contact 2-3 times for just doing some normal favors for each other. Now it has been over 5.5 month and there is no sign from him. I really am not the type of a person who starts the relationship, so I don't want to call him and ask him about his status. I am just wondering that shall I assume it is over? was he some kind of polite at the time he was explaining his situation? I am really confused... ESTJs please help me in understanding him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by November Rose   When an ESTJ is upset", to they want to be comforted, left alone, or to just vent? (Or something else?)     I like to be comforted but ONLY if I'm upset in front of someone I like/love (or want some attention from - any closer friend). But generally I like attention, so... if we're friends, I'd like to see that you care by comforting me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I'm upset in front of someone who's not close to me", I'd probably appreciate their efforts to comfort me, will get pissed off at their efforts to distract me with fun activities or to leave me alone, and still I'd wish that they left me alone cause 'it's none of their business'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Having control", as someone mentioned above, is mandatory. I mean... I (and probably 'we' - ESTJs) have complete and utter control even when we're upset. Maybe the other ESTJs react differently, I can't say, but even if I'm very upset, I'll get myself together quickly and remember who reacted how and did what (in reaction to my being upset) as information which I'll use somehow in the future. I gather information, A LOT of detailed information about anything I care about... and use it later. Manipulation? Maybe. Strategic thinking? Probably. ESTJ trait? I guess so...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Only someone I like/love can hurt me", and if I'm upset because of them, the person can fix it by comforting me, showing me that they care, paying attention to me. Others can do anything in the range of 'nothing' to 'annoy me'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I'm angry at something", short-term mutual venting will do and any person I'm angry at would better stay away from me as I may be really disrespectful, to the point where I don't feel it right (remember - we love the rule book).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know us SJ's are stereotyped as being conservative and traditional", but I feel for me It's more of what I grew up with than what society considered traditional. is it the same for you? Do you have family traditions?    I follow no traditions. That tradition-following image probably comes from the lack of being too spontaneous (and I mean 'too', because we are spontaneous sometimes). I don't conform much, not even on Christmas, Easter and other traditional holidays. Family traditions? WTF is that? Seriously, if it's something like going fishing every other Sunday of the month, I'd rather hate to do it - I don't like to HAVE-TO-DO anything. So... no ESTJs are the same, I guess.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   2. Do you consider yourself a private person?    Depends on what you mean when you say private. I'm private in terms of my important plans, and emotions which may change a result/goal I'm going after. I'm manipulative, so I'm private about what my true intentions are. For the sake of 'whatever-it-is' I can be really open, but it will be fake, and all I tell you will serve me some purpose. Of course, I can be honestly open (rarely, cause I don't really need to, I deal with my shit alone) but I'll never tell you something which you can effectively use against me... ever. (most people are not like that, so that could be not coming from the ESTJ personality, that could be just me specifically),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The only way you can make me be open", truthful, etc. with you is if you are more intelligent than I am and you've proven that you care about me a lot (by giving me more intelligent solutions to my problems) - that is if you want to make an ESTJ open up. Again - that could be just me.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   3. What's your biggest pet peeve in other people?    I can't stand stupid. Unintelligent. Too emotional. Especially, too emotional + stupid = get TF away from me. I also can't stand people who let other people walk all over them, people who don't stand up for themselves, weak, feeble, whatever... people who only follow and never lead. All else is negotiable but being an idiot in that way towards yourself and your life is what puts me off the most in other people.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   4.

I am but I don't really care about large groups and one-on-one is often more fun because it's more meaningful. Also, you can manipulate better one-on-one. Large groups are fun. One-on-one has some point. And I, personally, prefer it to have some point. Most extroverts probably like large groups because they haven't got a hidden agenda like I do. Introverts prefer one-on-one because they don't like large groups and whatever. My reasoning - I'll use either the one-on-one or the large group to my benefit. I like large groups, though, for fun.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   5. I'm ISTJ- could our types get along? I've never met any before and am curious about the dynamics.    I usually prefer extroverted people but if intelligent enough, an introvert will catch my attention. However, I can't stand people with no social skills, or people who avoid others. I don't like it when you don't communicate at all with the shop assistants or waiters, or if you can't talk to strangers (for whatever reason) because of being shy or avoiding people in general. I value social skills and I like anyone who's got better ones than mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	My grandfather is an ESTJ", and a very intelligent and learned one at that. However, I often find that disagreements (about e.g. environmental policy) cause us to have very heated discussions that lead nowhere. I find his Te-Si to be inflexible and unimaginative in such discussions - when I want to explore opportunities for improving the status quo, he'll shoot them down without even properly considering them in the bigger picture (in my opinion, anyway). He will also use his age and life experience as arguments in a discussion. These things can be really frustrating to me, but it also makes me wonder: how do you other ESTJs perceive Ti-users (perhaps particularly Ti-Ne) in discussions and debates?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I gotta catch you while your here since there's only a few of you", and even less females    I haven't dated an INFP, but I think my problems with my ex were not based on extroversion but rather the xNFP vs XSTJ differences. It was a great relationship in the beginning with the whole opposites attract idea but the differences were just too much as we became more serious. Our biggest issues came from the fact that I am very goal oriented and driven and I started to see him as more of a dreamer than a doer. It led to lots of fights where he thought I was bossy and I thought he wasn't practical and too emotional. Not saying it can't work if two people are really dedicated and willing to put in the effort, but we realized that we saw the world differently and wanted different things in life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thing is, the people in the teams below him (aka he is the boss of these various teams) do dress casual, with jeans and piercings and nerdy tshirts. The reason is: they are teams for marketing, graphic design, etc, so they are nerds and artsy people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	However", the boss's job is not artsy, he manages the projects and the teams. Also, his secretary/assistant dresses like you would expect a corporate person to dress. It's super weird to see them walk around together (she is his shadow, at his beck and call) because it's watching a nerd-looking guy followed by a hot victoria's secret model dressed in a suit, having meetings with sales people.

"ESTJ	You know", something I have noticed with my relationships with Te dominants is that their perception definitely changes how I'll get along with them. Pretty obvious, huh? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ENTJ's", after my Fe cloak wears out, will call me on my questionable lifestyle (I like to think it's because they care about me) and will actually change their whole attitude towards me until they see me changing and giving results. For example, I was very hesitant about going to college. An ENTJ I really respect was borderline upset with me for doing that and explained to me the importance of a certificate and how I should worry more about my future since my other alternatives didn't sound very good to him (you know," the typical ""my entrepreneurship will make me rich"" 18-year-old kinda thinking). I actually considered his point of view since he rationally explained it to me and made me think. The principles behind his", and many other's arguments linger in the back of my head when I make a decision, and it's come to be something useful. If we are both mature, my relationship with one will usually be cool at first, then kinda weird and awkward, then useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When an ESTJ and I meet", we usually shake hands. Then I say something or do something they will immediately ridicule me for. Then I try to apologize for it since I don't feel like arguing. Regardless, they will draw a conclusion about me in the first 5 minutes we meet. Then I get this itchy feeling on my back, the kind that signals me I need to get out of a situation ASAP. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	This is not always the case", of course. My INTJ best friend's mother is an ESTJ (this is very hard for him to deal with) and we get along just fine, mainly because she sees in me everything she wishes her son would have (I THINK, I'm not really sure).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When my sensor allies meet an ESTJ I may have been complaining about", they'll usually have nothing bad to say about them at all. When I see them speaking to such, they seem like fish in the water. I can totally see how Ne can irritate Te Si.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	As an ESTJ", do you ever find Ne irritating? Have you ever seen it in action and liked it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I have an ESTJ manager who often forgets the things she says she will do/forgets the things you have said to her (in regards to work related issues). It always completely confuses me because for someone who is so task and detailed oriented who generally remembers such weirdly specific details she'll completely forget something you've told her multiple times in the span of ten minutes. For me", even if I haven't rememberd a specific event I can picture myself understanding how that event would have come to be if someone mentions to me that I have forgot something (Ne) and I can move forward with intuition fixing whatever problem has come; my ESTJ manager will just compeletly forget and not just forget but vehemently deny such a thing ever being said/happening. I honestly don't know how to navigate this behavior she has. I've noticed this behavior in a few ESTJs and it perplexes me. I would assume for someone so logically consistent and detail oriented that these things wouldnt fly over an ESTJs head as much as it does?      Originally Posted by ANAXEL   As an ESTJ," do you ever find Ne irritating? Have you ever seen it in action and liked it?    Ne in ESTJs particularly of the slightly more relaxed version is super obvious. Especially in a more casual enviorment; you can see it in ESTJ ""story-time"" where an ESTJ will start going on random Si/Ne tangents; ESTJs can often have a really great sense of humor and be quite funny and enjoy creativity (you don't see it as much in ESTJ work mode). I have known some ESTJs to venture into art and creative projects. I think (bad) Ne grips in ESTJs make ESTJs seem *super* paranoid. Never fun to be in the presence of an ESTJ in a non-functioning Te-Ne loop - although it's kind of hilarious. My ESTJ manager will become just completely and utterly scatterbrained", paranoid by every possibility, messy (A lot of ESTJs are really messy and have like a sort of organized chaos I don't think cleanliness is actually a strength of a lot of ESTJs.) it's like she looses all sight of organizational skills. She will have papers and stuff everywhere, a mess that she made then complain that she can't work in an enviorment like that (but she doesn't even think to clean it up lol). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Every ESTJ I've known has hated my Ne (initially); but also loved it. I remember when I started working with my ESTJ manager she would tell people ""man this girl asks a lot of questions"". She would complain about it initially and I knew she didn't love the amount of questions I asked but at the end of day because of all my questions I would do everything right and cover all my bases (exactly why I do this). I look at every possibility and every situation from different angles so if a situatuon did come up I can react when that situation did come up. Eventually she was using me as example to other staff because I wasn't afraid to ask questions. And because of my questions I was doing everything right. ESTJs only find Ne annoying if there's no follow-through as long as you can prove your competence and it takes a long time for ESTJs to trust anyone so it's not overnight. Always expect some amount grumbles from an ESTJ though when you're talking to them with a lot of Ne (especially in a work enviorment). I've known many ESTJs to apologize for acting too harshly in the moment but don't expect it until later and probrably after you've proven yourself to them.

You're Te clashes with an INTJs Ti? INTJs have tert Te, do you mean INTPs? Because INTJs have tert Te. I can imagine INTJs getting along quite well with ESTJs so long as they are working towards the same goal/have the same vision and similar values. Otherwise it would not work. I suspect that INTJs will still respect ESTJs dom Te and ESTJs would respect INTJs vast intellect and forward thinking/goal setting. I know my boyfriend respects a lot of E*TJs I can only imagine him being in purposeful friendships with them however, I would suspect romantic relationships are a bit more rare. ESTJs can be a little to set in their ways for INTJs I think so relationships can be a bit harder to develop initially.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I've known both types pretty well and this breaks down the differences pretty well.    I think we can be philosophical as well some of us more then others. some of the more academic ones or ones who are more interested in more ideas an language", grammar and things. I think saying we just reminisce isn't really that accurate. I hope we don't just do that! I think the ENTJ definitely understand philosophy as a whole much better, I tried studying that stuff and couldn't get my head all the way around it. I am going to base this off a new acquaintance of mine from talking to him for like 10 maybe 15 minutes at most. He told me he's in to existentialism and nietzsche. That stuff has no appeal to me and I don't really want to go anywhere near it. I don't know if I get it either. He studied philosophy in college I am studying for English Journalism and political Science. I have a feeling I am much more in to the pragmatic and realism. I am always going to argue for the more traditional. Political philosophy is my realm where it is not the ENTJs. He'll approach politics from the less political science side more the what will work and the existential realm. I am much more no-nonsense then he is, I can detect  it, he's is a bit more thought out in a sense and a bit more flexible. He's probably a bit more fun and easy going and less likely to tell you right out what he thinks. I don't know if he can talk about the trivial, I can talk about that kind of stuff a bit more I think and not exactly get bored. I don't talk about it like my ESFJ dad but I can sort of talk about simple stuff too, where as this guy would probably wonder off and talk I dunno music theory? he plays and teaches music.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I never challenged her even though sometimes our slight differences usually small and opinion based. I would say something and Irene sort of squashed it and the discussion went no further. We sort of ganged up on her husband me the teenage ESTJ and Irene. I felt a bit sorry for Richard sometimes but Irene was right. He had schizophrenia, but maybe I don't feel sorry because soon after her death months later Richard got married again. Richard had always wanted to leave Irene but she wouldn't let him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	If you wanna know something about ESTJ's emotions in general", then it's likely a thing they are most vulnerable at, completely their weakest part. In healthy manner emotional needs shouldn't be ignored by ESTJ, but rather be very personal and very unknown even to ESTJ himself. At least this is what I think. Using emotions makes me feel 'weak', it's just not my thing, but I appreciate them a lot. I surely feel them, but often don't really comprehend them completely, fail to express them, overall it's something to hide and to keep for yourself, because I wouldn't want to make a wrong step. Meanwhile dominant thinking function is complete opposite, it can be powerful, brash, outbursting and spitting logic, where it needs to. So if you think, you can read very subtle things and silent agreements, then relationship can start. I can say that after my grandpa's death, almost 5 months ago, I still haven't touched emotional conversations topic. Not because I don't feel anything, but because becoming vulnerable freaks me out. Similar to being naked in public. And the thing is that I probably felt the biggest emotional impact out of all of those people, but I never told that to anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So i'm actually wondering how you guys perceive it, like what is really going on inside your head when you encounter smb like that.    I believe I can help. With less self-aware ESTJ's, inferior Fi suppresses their own feeling based judgments and so they tend to consider that the same in others is also a weakness. It's a projection. They have spent their lives suppressing their feeling based judgements and that has given them success so it becomes a self-repeating cycle of suppression > validation - which then again gets projected to others because they had success with it. Emotions while not Jungian related in terms of psychology similarly also got repressed because repression for them reaps rewards over time ... Then comes the nature of Si where it's mostly projection of what worked for them would work for others - and since repression of emotion worked for them," it'll work for someone else too. Most (if not all) ESTJ's don't have the time or the energy or even desire to understand emotions of others at all because they're so busy repressing all of that F related ""stuff"" in their own mind. They need to be repressed because if they're not repressed then they get in the way of achieving what they wanted to achieve. My dad is a lot like your mom in that regard. Only after turning 73 has he started somewhat exploring his emotional side", but even then he'll share a few emotional things one day and then go back to his repressive state the next like nothing ever happened. Right now one of my cousins is dying of a stroke (he's only 51) and my dad has no emotion to speak of. None at all. It's clear that he's buried it so deep that it seems like it doesn't even exist - and he probably believes that it doesn't exist for him either. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So i'm actually wondering how you guys perceive it, like what is really going on inside your head when you encounter smb like that.    To me it looks like type unrelated thing here. I think it depends more on upbringing, culture, past of that person. It's something like you don't expect thug to understand that, but you expect your psychologist to understand. Imagine similar thing mixed up and spreaded everywhere. Many people would be something in the middle. ESTJs in particular have it a bit different. Likely you see them dealing with their weakness. Some will deal, some not. In your example ESTJ (yet I would doubt that) somewhat tries to start up rusty Fi, but way superior Te just drives over it, completely takes over control. I personally would listen to what other's tell me about their emotions, but stuff gets complicated when there's a choice of Fi and Te. Te is default," ""at home"" way", Fi is something person needs to put more effort for it to work," comparable to ""being with guests"," you never knew before"". It's probably the most what could be told", because jungian typology isn't a set in stone bible for people's behaviour. Most often you still have to think outside of it, you have to observe person and see how he/she works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ			   Firstly", I'm sorry for your loss. If I may offer a perspective on how...or rather who...to go about sharing your emotions to. This is my completely uneducated analysis of the cognitive functions at play ...What you're after is someone to understand how you'e feeling about your loss (satisfies Fi) and approve and validate it completely (satisfies Te). I believe this is the source of the vulnerability for ExTJs, especially since they can't always understand let alone explain the depth of their pain. If the Te approval is not met, it will severely hurt your Fi. Ti-Fe works in the reverse, to understand a concept (Ti) and for the collective to decide on how to feel about it (Fe). With Fe...the verbal etiquette surrounding death can sometimes feel hollow, and some people are dismissive and don't understand others' grieving process. And that's why it's important to have someone in your life that you trust completely, even if just one or two people. What that trustworthiness looks like is that even if they don't immediately understand what you're going through, they will believe you when you say you're hurting very deeply and ask questions if necessary. You want to find someone who takes an interest in your life and asks a lot of questions about you. Understanding is really the key to feeling comforted. I see ESTJs with people in their life who are just there because of what they can do for them, nothing more. But do they care to really know on a deep level who is the person who's doing all these things for them, and more importantly, how are they feeling? No.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally Posted by happycrazy   This is my completely uneducated analysis of the cognitive functions at play    I would say that cognitive functions shouldn't be integrated in our analysis as it's almost always better to just think like normal human. From what I have seen, integrating cognitive function theory often makes situations look very different and not realistic. I would stay away from those as that limits my human capabilities. Typology only is interested in very narrow field of human mind mechanics. And feeling like it's a big thing is foolish.

I believe this is the source of the vulnerability for ExTJs, especially since they can't always understand let alone explain the depth of their pain.    They can, but not with great stability. Not sure if Fi would like someone else intruding in their life. It's rather secretive and alone function, delicate to service.

You kept talking about Fe and magically there's a need for understanding person. Maybe to Fi Fe approach can look shallow, but yet again it depends. I felt almost nothing in church, but when I got to that house. The house those grandparents were living and I spent my childhood summers into. I couldn't handle. Memories were fresh, I saw some of his things, like clothes, glasses. It felt like he should be here, but he wasn't. That was very hard to see, I sat down on chair in the kitchen (first room after little corridor in that house). I couldn't handle that and tears started to flow. That was my weakest moment. Now I sort of remember things that he did or how he did some stuff. It's a village, so lots of things had to be done outside. Even if it's wrong to say, I will say that he was to me more of father figure than my own father. I still know more about him as person than I do about my own father. I can tell you more, but I don't think I need. You can see that Fi here isn't handicapped thing at all, only not preferred way of dealing with things. I have told whole story to one person in perC. So I had a person to which I could tell everything. I can say that what I wrote about the death and my feelings, could qualify as art. Even if Fi 4th, it can shine more than some people's 1st.

You want to find someone who takes an interest in your life and asks a lot of questions about you. Understanding is really the key to feeling comforted.    Possibly, but person can't be from my relatives. Grandma almost needs help herself due to loss, mom doesn't have a good emotional support capabilities. Dad is too unknown person (this is his father who is dead).

But do they care to really know on a deep level who is the person who's doing all these things for them, and more importantly, how are they feeling? No.    I dunno if I want to agree with that. You may be a bit too harsh about other people, but what you say holds some truth. Not many are willing to investigate with what person they are with. I personally dumped natural human desire to reach for success, like money, house, car... All that stuff to low level or to sensoric appreciation level only. I hold feeling at higher value. I often feel not so good, when people only care about grades, what you achieve in your life. I feel that this is wrong to ignore the wonders of other people, that have no monetary value. Many things can't be counted with paper. We do enjoy many things that affect us differently. I think I seek that. I sort of started to hate school for not focusing much on anything else, but grades. It feels disgusting that the only thing we are trying to achieve in that place is just how to score higher on some meaningless stuff. I'm a bad student. I have no attitude to just learn, but I may have entered a secret stage of learning the stuff that many others don't even think about. I sort of became a vandal. Started to vandalise some property, destroy things. Not a lot, just a bit. Totally not a great thing to do, but still even in there I can only see the same pattern. You destroy property and you are bad person," but what's lacking is some thoughts about ""bad people"". No one cares if you have problems", somewhat want to express yourself. You can be either good or bad, based on way too simplicistic logic. No one cares to investigate those works that are bad as something more neutral, worth to be investigated further. Hell, even my username should suggest something. It's my best attempt at defining me and it's The red spirit. Deep philosophy of life with unique desires. I changed my type to ESTJ some days ago, not sure if I should have done that. My previous type was ISTP. I always feel like some great things about person aren't defined by type. Those noobs, who enter MBTI world and think this is some mega cool godsent stuff are likely the worst thing to happen. Some dudes wanted to touch the depths of the people, but rarely anyone wants to investigate further. Then later some people believe it's the greatest touch of depth to ever exist. That's not true. Not true at all, but who understand that? WHO!? Almost no one.

"ESTJ	Usually people say ESTJs are mean and not affectionate "," then someone comes in with an exception like ""ESTJs aren't mean and not affectionate contrary to popular belief.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It goes back and forth. ESTJs prefer to be more professional in their approach with strangers", not mean, not too nice, just neutral. With people they are close too they can relax and show affection but it is not in ways that are obvious to people who do not know them," some forms of ESTJ affection can be making you the butt of their jokes (this is a way to draw attention to you and pick you out of a group of people to say ""Hey", I notice you, and I like you as a person," otherwise I wouldn't be taking the time to say your name let alone make a joke about you."") Super duper forms of affection are not normal for an ESTJ", they can put on a professional smile, they can be polite to strangers just fine but this does not mean much and only is done because it's how one must conduct themselves in public, or to show they were raised right. This whole professional demeanor is dropped with close friends, as they joke more say more crude things and relax. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ESTJs also do not dislike nice people and they appreciate truly kind people", what they find uncomfortable and distrusting is huge displays of flagrant emotion," they may not know why someone is being so favorable towards them or how honest someone is being when they dole out things like ""OH MY GOD I LOVE YOUUUUU! OH MY GOD I'VE MISSED YOUUUU."" And it's not common for an ESTJ to show those forms of affection. ESTJ forms of affection come more in the form of acts of service. If an ESTJ ever shows concern in your well being or your problems", they care about you to some extent to supply their greatest strength and asset to you, their energy and their time, because ESTJs can be highly scheduled people and do not give their precious time to things that do not matter to them, because they have something more important to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	All the ESTJs I've known they've never been super affectionate", even one girl I knew and friends with was not super affectionate, it's more like they are enthusiastic about helping me if I have a goal or a problem," and that's an easy way to see ""Wow this person is a real friend!"" and it's easy to see they care about you through that enthusiasm. I remember one time I missed my bus and it was driving to a bus stop a mile down the street", my ESTJ friend who dropped me off at my current bus stop, saw that I missed my bus," and he pulled up to me and said ""Hey"," let's catch that bus."" Like some old time movie crime partner lol", I hopped in the car and he raced after that bus, and he didn't feel burdened or anything, he was excited to help even though it had nothing to do with him, that felt like real friendship, no affection or any of that stuff needed (also we are both guys so that's weird lol). I've also had another ESTJ friend who I let stay at my apartment for 2 months, he fixed me lunch for work everyday he stayed there LOL, without asking, and he cooked for me and my roommate, without asking, we are both guys so it was weird at first but he was happy to do it, and felt like he couldn't stay in my house without contributing something, even though nothing was required, good friend, no extra emotion or affection needed once again, and we are close. I've had another ESTJ friend pay for his own and my plane flight ticket," just because he was excited I agreed to go out of town to an event with him. That to me seems like and ESTJ being ""affectionate."" But I think with strangers they'd rather be professional", polite, neutral, or just social, but not super emotionally expressive or accommodating to people they do not know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I mean I've seen an ESTJ talk about how when his daughter started to distance herself from him when she was in her rebellious teens", he just started to bring her in closer, taking her everywhere with him and trying to keep the relationship strong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I've also seen an ESTJ cry many times in public about his wife who passed away years ago", and the way he talks about her you can tell he loved her and she was everything to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	So yea", they are people, like everybody else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I know these are really personalized examples", so at best they just provide a bunch of exceptions to common stereotypes, but at least it shows there is no one way to be ESTJ even if thre are common trends among them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by happycrazy   Oh I have a real question now...are ESTJs bored by ""nice"" people?    Not at all. I really appreciate nice people. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I do", however, get bored with people who are nice to the point of being doormats. Or people who lack a certain level of decisiveness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Do ESTJ's test potential romatic partners? I feel like I am being tested. Watched... kind of set up to see how I will respond to things. Is this typical of an ESTJ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by tamalynn   Do ESTJ's test potential romatic partners? I feel like I am being tested. Watched... kind of set up to see how I will respond to things. Is this typical of an ESTJ?    Personally", this isn't something I do. Generally speaking, this isn't something ESTJs do. The type is known for being straightforward to a fault. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I have always seen my brother as a ESTJ. He used to be extremely outgoing and partying between 18-22", but then settled down and now is more a career and family person... rarely meets friends on spare time. I asked him to take the test and he got ESTJ.. He, himself says that he feels like he is more a introvert (although have good social skills) and his wife who is also a Introvert, sees him as a introvert as well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Do you ESTJ usually feel like you are introverts", or do you think he might be an ISTJ    I don't know what the deal is with some extroverts thinking they are introverts. I see this misunderstanding occur more than introverts thinking they might be extroverts. Maybe it's a lack of self awareness for some, I'm not sure. But some ESTJs can be very quite and not social, simply because they aren't interested in what the group is talking about, but once you talk to them about themselves or something they know, you can tell this person could have a conversation with a wall, meaning that once they get started they do not require you to speak anymore lol,<< Extrovert. My Pastor is an ESTJ and he think's he's an introvert because sometimes he likes to get alone and take a break from socializing and read a book -_-. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	What I honestly think is this", someone will read the extrovert and introvert descriptions," and an extrovert might read the E descriptions through the lens of ""this is normal behavior everybody does this."" and when they read the I description they see it through the lens of ""Oh wow I do that sometimes"," that's what that is? Wow I must be an introvert since I do like alone time sometimes."" Not realizing that their own surprise at why they might like alone time occasionally is the very thing that exposes them as an extrovert"," if alone time is something surprising or ""different"" or unusual for you", but not really necessary, you are an E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	TLDR:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Sorry", that probably was a load you did not even care to read lol. I agree, I do think some EXTJs can come off like and think they are extroverts, since they can be socially detached because they simply are not interested in the conversation at had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks for the answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	In my mind", I determine extroverts/introverts by asking if they get energy from being with people or being alone. Ofcourse most people are a mix and need both a social life and some alone time, if they are not to the other extreme. But you get a general idea of what the preference is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	According to my brother and his wife", he doesnt mind not socializing alot with people on his spare time... His family is enough for him (to put it in perspective, he has been married and been like this the last 8 years, so its not just a phase thing),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	So to summarize what i have written into a single question", is a wife and two kids enough social stimulation for some ESTJ long term, or would you get bored?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
