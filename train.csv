"ESTJ	Being an ESTJ", I've got some stereotypes that I'd like to debunk:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1. ESTJ's are boring because they play by the rules.Totally incorrect. We respect the rules", but that doesn't mean we don't play our butts off. I mean, serisouly, when you play by the rules, you're bound to have more fun when you win, because you did it fairly and without any extra help. Part of my philosophy: work hard, play hard. We ESTJ's may play by the rules, but if there's a loophole, you can bet we'll find it and exploit it! hahaha2. ESTJ's are bossy.This isn't necessarily true. Sure, we can come across as domineering and/or demanding, but it's usually because the people we're dealing with are completely incompetent, or they're shirking responsibility. One thing that I hate (and I'm guessing other ESTJ's do, too)," is irresponsibility.3. ESTJ's are ""penny-wise and uber-pound-wise.""This also isn't necessarily true. I have the tendency to be fairly lax with money. I work to make it so I can spend it on things that I want. That's the point of having a job", right?What do you think?,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I don't agree.  I've witnessed many times an ESTJ not expressing their true anger towards something to save their image.

Do the words 'anger' and 'abusive' somehow come close to the definition of the ESTJ type for you (or even the stereotype)? If they do, they shouldn't. Those are words describing a mentally unhealthy individual, not the good portion of everyday humanity that ESTJ and similar types represent. Any individual with problems can be agressive, passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful, from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between. An ESTJ who accepts himself and learns to live with his own weaknesses will never be abusive or angry by simple definition, no more than an INFP or any other introverted feeler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	IXXP types are the ones which give the most frequent examples of passive agressive behaviour. An ESTJ would much more likely be outright agressive to the face of anything they find aggravating. They would sooner try to domineer a situation than try to undermine it passively. Their nature is such", they confront what they dislike directly, they don't accept situations they dislike and later fight them in a war of passive agressive attrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Though", of course, I'm only stereotyping from my own experience. My INFP mother, aunt and best friend are quite the artists of passive agression when they need to be (like today apparently..... ffs.).

My ESTJ grandfather, on the other hand, just tends to yell at things that anger him and tries to pull in connections with old friends to get someone he doesn't know fired.    All my statements are only based from my own experiences as well and unfortunately all the male ESTJs I have met are either abusive physically or emotionally.  Every ESTJ I know is extremely passive aggressive; way more than any ESTP, ESFP, INFP, ISFP, or INTP I know. So for example; if an ESTJ was to be abusive towards another individual it would most likely be behind closed door, while an ESTP wouldn't care as much who it's around. If an ESTJs values are threatened and an INFPs values are threatened, in my observations the INFP would less likely care about getting angry and yelling in front of a huge crowd of people than an ESTJ would. ESTJs are less straight forward when it comes to conflicts; they want to save face at whatever cost," so they wait until they're in the domineering position and cannot be threatened by outsiders to lash out on their victims. That's pretty passive aggressive in my opinion. Of course I do agree with your statement of ""Any individual with problems can be agressive", passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful," from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between."" I just stereotype ESTJs and ESTPs to be the most abusive.

"ESTJ	Jeez", i really do not like ESTJs (no offense to the ESTJ's) but the ones i've met seem to be very materialistic, and just didnt care that much about others. I find that the conversations that i have are very different then the ones they have...Whats boring to me is intersting to them. Whats interesting for me is boring to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	An example of this..is when i went out with my ex at least two years ago...and my best friend was on the phone with his girl and we had a fourway conversation...and my bestfriends girl said ""sometimes i just like to look at the window and look at the stars. When the conversation was done between all of us. My ex said "" That girl is special or somethin like that"," something that degraded her"" and I thought to myself. This girl definitely isnt for me...but like the idiot i was i stayed with her for another 6 months...ten months all together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Same here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I had a boss who fit the ESTJ profile spot on. I was terrified of her. She was very intelligent", but she had not people skills, was a HUGE micromanager, and would also gossip and get people she did not like fired. She rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. It  is sad to hear so many have had such painful experiences with this personality type.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I am sure that there are some admirable ESTJs out there", I just have not met any yet...it seems the bad apples just ruin the whole barrel :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	You found an ESTJ that didn't care about others???? That's seems odd since we're the guardians...I would agree about a few of the stereotypes. As an ESTJ here's what I think is correct (that is in a healthy individual)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I don't know if we're the most mature of all types. But I would say that we're pretty old. I've been like a mother since age 3. Even some of my friends jokingly call me mom whenever I do things for them. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	- I would say that we are pretty assertive", like what you see is what you get and if you are in trouble you'll know it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- Not accepting of change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- Have a hard time accepting help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Think of us a the ultimate Italian mama. She may yell", but she gets everyone moving along and fed, and they love her for it. :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I'm sure there are plenty of people in this world that don't like me because of my personality type", but in my case I've found the key factor is weather people are F's or T's.  Every single one of my friends is a T.  My husband is an INTP," which actually works out incredibly well.  He sort of needs someone to ""do the things he doesn't like to do""", like planning and cleaning the house, and I really need to have someone who listens to me and gives me great advice, he is great at creating a big picture plan, and I'm good with the details.  Now F's on the other hand, I can barely understand you guys.  It really stinks because 75% of women are F's," so most of my friends are men.  I do have a few girlfriends but many of them just have a hard time with how I will basically tell it like it is and I'm not very concerned with their ""feelings"".  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I think that lots of F's take everything I say too personally", I'm generally not trying to offend them.  Think of Dr. Tempe Brennan on Bones, she just says things that are true sometimes even if others find them insensitive, I can't even understand why people would be offended by my pointing out the truth about something.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It's also challenging to be a ESTJ female", because I want to be in control of situations but on the other hand I also want to be feminine and believe in a traditional female role for me in my family.  This can definitely be a challenge for me to balance.  Now about the stereotypes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-controlling - Yes", I am this way.  Especially when I think that others are incompetent, if someone has earned my trust and I'm managing them I will let them do whatever they want, but earning my trust isn't super easy.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Authoritarian -Yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Lacking in imagination (Yes and no", I'm good at coming up with creative solutions to problems," but I'm the kind to sit around ""imagining a different world"" like my INTP", or even one to be very artsy/creative.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Bullying - I am not a bully.  I don't pick on people or say mean things about them for no reason.  I may tell someone the truth.  For instance"," if someone is perpetually late I might say ""It would be helpful if you could show up on time""", but I don't just attack people because I think they're weak or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Overly Competitive - Not really", I like to win, but I lose pretty well too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Can't Admit It When They're Wrong - I am addicted to finding to concrete truth", and I admit being wrong pretty easily, although usually I'll want some time on my own to think about things before admitting I was wrong.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Impatient -Very True",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Mainstream - I am very weird", especially politically, Although if it was 1776 I would be mainstream...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-A perfect example of Arthur Schopenhauer's quote: ""all truth passes through three stages: first it is ridiculed", second it is violently opposed," third it is accepted as self evident."" ...I don't really get what this is trying to say", am I the one who passes through three stages or is this what I'm supposed to think about others?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- I would say that we are pretty assertive", like what you see is what you get and if you are in trouble you'll know it   - I agree with this ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- Not accepting of change  : I do not like change for no reason...I want to know why things are changing before I'll go along with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- Have a hard time accepting help: This is very true about me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	About Angry ESTJ:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I was a teen I had grown up in the kind of household where people yell and scream at each other every day.  As a result I also had an anger management problem.  I had a hard time dealing with conflict in any way and would often end up yelling or getting mad.  At some point I decided I had crossed a line and decided to change.  I gradually learned to control my anger and I can't think of a single time I have yelled or screamed at anyone since I've been at an adult.  If an ESTJ you know is yelling at people it is because they can't see how much it is damaging themselves and their own lives", and they don't know how to deal with the intense emotions that we feel about things.  I believe in things incredibly strongly, my beliefs are not a passing fancy, they make up my whole person and each day I strive to make sure I'm living by them.  If you're brave enough, maybe you should mention to one of these friends that they're anger is mostly damaging them, not others, and that others lose respect for them when they get angry.  When I learned that, it was easy for me to change.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Also", yes we are selfish, actually I think all people are, but that's another story :).  It is incredibly hard for me to emphasize with the hardships of others if I don't know them personally.  I can only see rational arguments.  For instance, when I watch one of those commercials for dying children in africa I truly do believe it's sad....but I also cannot believe that blindly giving aid to them is the solution.  Clearly to me the solution is helping their country by bringing in industry, business, and jobs.  The way that the US was built.  Giving people bare necessities does not bring them into independence, it only makes them believe the way to get aid is by staying poor.  Call me insensitive, but the US didn't become the wealthiest country in the world by accepting charity, and I'm not sure we would have if we had had charity.  I'm not saying I don't like charities, but they are always the ones where people help themselves... like scholarships for academic excellence, or if I hear of someone who has escaped from Cuba and made it to the US, I want to take them in.  Anyway, I'm not saying that I can't understand the plight of sick children, but if we spent half as much money building up power plants in Africa as we did on feeding them, I think the difference would be more substantial and lead to the only life I can see as worth living, the one where you are financially independent.  ,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Ok this was a really long post so If you made it to hear", bravo, and if not, O well :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Cookie Monster   I had a boss who fit the ESTJ profile spot on. I was terrified of her. She was very intelligent", but she had not people skills, was a HUGE micromanager, and would also gossip and get people she did not like fired. She rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. It  is sad to hear so many have had such painful experiences with this personality type.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I am sure that there are some admirable ESTJs out there", I just have not met any yet...it seems the bad apples just ruin the whole barrel :(    One of the only people I've ever had a long standing grudge with is an ESTJ. It didn't help that she was my boss at 2 different jobs and my sister-in-law. I could sense her irritation with me not being 100% perfect at my jobs," both I just started with no experience. She would let me know everything I did wrong even if I already knew and was correcting it. Every day she'd say ""You're killing me Sarah"," you're killing me."" Her way seemed to be the only right way she would even try to tell me how I should spend my money and what I care about. I always respected her and kept quiet because she was my boss and also family that I had to see out of work and did not want to create a rift. She couldn't respect my N", while she was very observant of everything around her she didn't like that I wasn't and that it was a problem. The last straw was her showing up unannounced ( I was asleep), accusing me of stealing company money, and demanding I write a check, when payroll was HER job and she put it in my account. No one has ever treated me so absurdly. She was although generous, hard working, would do anyone a favor, and loyal to her family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Its very easy to hold a grudge against any personality type. I know I for one have. However", it seems like I lot of you have had experiences with an unhealthy ESTJ, which although I am very sorry about that, is no excuse to generalize our type. My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Is possible that these ESTJ's you are having problems with simply dont know they're acting this way? Especially if they are family wouldn't you like a good relationship with them? We are extroverts", aka not good at listening, we're not always good at noticing when we do something that may seem offensive or controlling, and no we're not really that gushy. But I will tell you that we are complete suckers for those in pain, especially if it is because of something we said or did. It simply crushes us. All I can say is, I am way more of a softer person because my mom and sister (ENFP and INFP) both had the guts to tell me that what i was doing was hurtful to them. I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Believe me", I know a lot about being that mean bully that you all can see. But I never knew I was doing that until my sister flat out told me. We're kind of like the dog who barks really loudly and bares his teeth at you, but then will freely let you sleep on his stomach and guard you from all dangers once you've made friends. I have a chow dog and if you've ever met one, they're in particularly similar an ESTJ. I've never had a more loyal dog.

Recently, during the whole self-absorbed exchange, I wrote her 4 VERY to pretty long e-mails trying to explain what I'd been going through and why that may have appeared self-absorbed, but that I don't think I'm a self-absorbed person by nature.

"ESTJ	What a great opportunity to break the mold of ESTJ! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Me", as lantern, here to do just that: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1.) Does not question the law - I guess so", but I don't mind doing the odd 'naughty' thing just for the sake of hedonism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2.) Conservative - Not really", quite liberal....not that into politics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3.) Bullies - Hell", no - not even near. Bullies need a whack round the head. I don't like unnecessary unkind words.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4.) Unprogressive - Uhhh....no....I'm a take-charge person. If something I want done I will do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	5.) Paranoid - Only if something really matters to me and I want a positive outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	6.) Bias towards their own beliefs - Yes", my cultural beliefs - I question some of my family traditions, I'm not rigid towards these beliefs, but there are some I hold true value to my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	7.) Critical of others - Only if it's someone who is incompetent in their work", and their incompetence is affecting others not just me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	8.) Strict - Not really", I do like some routine but really appreciate flexibility - you've gotta live!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	9.) Boring - I don't believe I'm boring. I love to have fun", depends on who I'm with though, if I'm with work colleagues there's only so far I would go - got a reputation to keep. Outside of work, with my usual friends, I let my hair down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others - Yes to an extent", I say it in the most kindest way I can. Why fool someone you care about with a silly lie - when you know full well that they won't benefit in the long run?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Yes I am all polite and formal at first", depending on who I'm talking to - this to me constituents good manners - I don't feel comfortable talking about my personal life straight away - I have never met anyone who is immediately open with their life stories. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	IF I feel", have made the decision that I can fully trust someone I am OPEN....I don't give a bull's eye - I have fun, I have broken rules....I am not some stiff person who looks like I have a coin up my backside, I have my values and I stick by them such as loyalty and respect. I'm down-to-earth, I dislike hierarchy, I prefer talking to people who have no airs about them, I believe everyone is equal, we are all the same, we eat, drink and go to the toilet, get sick and everything else - we are all human. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She didn't seem to comprehend with your situation, not even one bit. ,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I know an INFP and we don't share the same interests either but we got along pretty fine for the most part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Sometimes it's hard for me to understand him", but I try my best to let him give me the opportunity to understand him without his descriptions being detailed, I didn't want to ask too many questions while he was also depressed, so I decided to give him space and let him think for himself for a second while I'm always there for him! it wasn't intentional though that whenever he told me about how he felt when he was depressed, he told me to stop rationalizing how he feels. I didn't even know I was doing it but at the same time, I was all ears and talked to him for hours on end so he could feel better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	To add a note to that", not all ESTJs are like that. Some get along great and some don't despite of the ESTJ and the INFP differences. I do think that it was best that you let go of the friendship that isn't progressing or if she isn't understanding or is willing to but this experience shouldn't get you to think about ESTJs in general. Some friendships aren't meant to be, it was best that you moved on. I hope you're doing fine!   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Believe me", I know a lot about being that mean bully that you all can see. But I never knew I was doing that until my sister flat out told me. We're kind of like the dog who barks really loudly and bares his teeth at you, but then will freely let you sleep on his stomach and guard you from all dangers once you've made friends. I have a chow dog and if you've ever met one, they're in particularly similar an ESTJ. I've never had a more loyal dog.    INFj's are your dual and match so I guess it makes sense that with a little effort you can learn to not only understand them but to also build a great relationship with them; they protect your emotions and you guard them...works out nicely, for the most part, I think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think he fits more of what your version of an ESTJ is. A lot of people disliked him because he took his job way too seriously, but I also know ESTJs who aren't like that, for example one of my childhood friends. She had a little streak of it when she was a little girl, but she grew out of it a lot time ago. She takes care of children who aren't related to her and keeps an eye over them, but in all the time that I've spent with her, I never felt as though it was domineering or pushy, she just cared for their well being. I can attest to her goodwill, especially in comparison to a lot of people I know. Perhaps she does it because she wants to be liked, but is that really so bad?

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by s0ulsurreal   All my statements are only based from my own experiences as well and unfortunately all the male ESTJs I have met are either abusive physically or emotionally.  Every ESTJ I know is extremely passive aggressive; way more than any ESTP", ESFP, INFP, ISFP, or INTP I know. So for example; if an ESTJ was to be abusive towards another individual it would most likely be behind closed door, while an ESTP wouldn't care as much who it's around. If an ESTJs values are threatened and an INFPs values are threatened, in my observations the INFP would less likely care about getting angry and yelling in front of a huge crowd of people than an ESTJ would. ESTJs are less straight forward when it comes to conflicts; they want to save face at whatever cost," so they wait until they're in the domineering position and cannot be threatened by outsiders to lash out on their victims. That's pretty passive aggressive in my opinion. Of course I do agree with your statement of ""Any individual with problems can be agressive", passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful," from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between."" I just stereotype ESTJs and ESTPs to be the most abusive.    I find immature ENTPs the most abusive ", especially verbally. I have a abusive ESTJ father but I think his abuse is not based on his being an ESTJ. He's not a healthy ESTJ so I can't go blaming it on his ESTJness. An unhealthy personality will be abusive or manipulative because they aren't in the right mind frame.

I would say most ESTJ's i have met would agree with most of everything in your rebuttal but you haven't actually rebutted anything you have literally just confirmed what was said.

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Charlie   on what basis do you think they're ""the most matured""? I'm curious for your reasoning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I had an ESTJ boss loudly yell at me in front of customers/ fellow employees when I went out of my way to help a fellow co-worker", who was overloaded with work.  Apparently, I wasn't supposed to help anyone,  just stay in my section even if I had nothing to do. It was my first day and I went into the back room and cried.    aw, thats terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	unfortunatly many dont understand but they cant yell even if have made a misstake (which you havnt)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	the boss", i had one ESTJ superviser, she would tell me off for every small error (i dont dare to call it  amisskate) but she would take me to the back room. thats the policy in most of places, things are sorted out notr when there are other colleques and customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2nd thing is that he told you off unreasonably. if i dont have customers i have to do something you cant just stand (my boss says)) its also a good expression of a teamwork. so you havnt done anything wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	 you can also raise such issues with the bosses boss or with HR", if the boss however given clear instructions on weather he wants you to stand behind your counter even if you have nothing to do or help others then best to follow that rule even if its wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by KrystRay   Right", but verbally abusing people, especially when you know its something you do... And ESTJ's are the sadistic ones???    yeah they are. coz they dont are how it sounds if thats true. but the thig is thats truth for them not for everyone. and also there are things like tact. some things even when you think its true, shoud be kept it coz they are non of your business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by WickedQueen   Yeah"," while you run here and there screaming ""I'm a free man! I don't obey rules!""", ESTJs work their ass harder than anyone to build a good future for everyone. Leading companies, manage social institutions, put bad guys in jail, and saving civilians in war areas. ESTJs strives to give our best contributions to society. That is our purpose of life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	We can be bad if we want. At least -I- can. But sacrificing ourselves for the greater good is much more important for us than being a selfish free guy who likes to disobey the rules", disturbing public peace," and belittling others who work hard to support his sorry-ass freedom.    the steriotype "" like showing how great they are"" just been confirmed. yes they work hard - doing unnessesary things. others work hard too"," but they dont show off as much as ESTJs. the things ""you do"" listed in a above comment are not just the ones ESTJs its what everyone does",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	other than that ESTJs dont provide future and rarely manage companies. coz they dont have any vision they are too stuck in details of todays day- in practicalities. managing directors are generally ENTPs or ENTJs", ESTJs are lower management- BBC calles them Supervisors- they make sure admin stuff is done, every box is ticked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by kept81213   Its very easy to hold a grudge against any personality type. I know I for one have. However", it seems like I lot of you have had experiences with an unhealthy ESTJ, which although I am very sorry about that, is no excuse to generalize our type. My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Is possible that these ESTJ's you are having problems with simply dont know they're acting this way? Especially if they are family wouldn't you like a good relationship with them? We are extroverts", aka not good at listening, we're not always good at noticing when we do something that may seem offensive or controlling, and no we're not really that gushy. But I will tell you that we are complete suckers for those in pain, especially if it is because of something we said or did. It simply crushes us. All I can say is, I am way more of a softer person because my mom and sister (ENFP and INFP) both had the guts to tell me that what i was doing was hurtful to them. I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Believe me", I know a lot about being that mean bully that you all can see. But I never knew I was doing that until my sister flat out told me. We're kind of like the dog who barks really loudly and bares his teeth at you, but then will freely let you sleep on his stomach and guard you from all dangers once you've made friends. I have a chow dog and if you've ever met one, they're in particularly similar an ESTJ. I've never had a more loyal dog.    we can generalise because the ESTJs i met are like that too, and see how many of them are! its not coz of 1 person, i can also agree with what he says here and we have known diferent ESTJs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	if it would be 1 or 2 ESTJ examples who came accross like that then fair enough we couldnt generalise", but if they are generally like that, then although Im sorry you have to hear that, it is their steriotype for a reason, see how many people arount the forum have similar opinions to that person?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	even if there are 1-2 exclusions", generally most of them are like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you are younger and surrounded by them they can really get into ""mob mentality"" and the ones I knew would laugh at things that they didn't understand or sometimes even hear if they thought it would put someone that they thought was strange on the spot and make them look bad. My stepdad was an ESTJ and had a very ""my-way-or-the-highway"" approach to everything. Even when I would explain a more efficient alternative. I remember being a kid arguing with him for hours about things like why I should be allowed to sleep with my door closed", or why 10:30 was a more appropriate bedtime. Though, with age I have come to understand them, and my stepdad and I get along MUCH better now that I am a grown man.

Well here's my 2 cents I believe it has something to do with a small penis/penis envy. Cops feel insecure and need a gun to feel adequate.  No one become a cop to help people, and they don't do it for pay either - hence the gun. Who would want a job, where you have the power to take someone's life? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	ESTJs are the rational", less emotional types. The people you describe are certainly not being rational and are letting emotion rule. I can assure you, I do not run around assaulting people - (1) it is an emotional response - we are not the feely, sensitive people, (2) likely to land you in jail - ESTJs love rules and think we should all abide in them and (3) overall, quite ineffective in getting the desired result.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think ESTJ's learn along the way that laws, meanings and ESTJ-like truths aren't the only thing that life is about, like any other personality learns that their personality is not the only truth.

Someone who is abusive has a psychological problem, it isn't part of their personality. None of us march around, or want to live in a slave society. I would not be described as uncreative at all.

A perfect example of Arthur Schopenhauer's quote: ""all truth passes through three stages: first it is ridiculed", second it is violently opposed," third it is accepted as self evident."" ...I don't really get what this is trying to say", am I the one who passes through three stages or is this what I'm supposed to think about others?    You're thinking a little too much about it and self-analyzing. It was meant to be thought-provoking. It is a proven fact that throughout history, whenever people have come up with new, innovative ideas, those who blindly and ardently cling to the status quo ridicule it because they aren't intelligent or open-minded enough to see that it may actually be plausible (true story, my ENFP beau as a Theoretical Physicist has this problem all the time. Many of the people he works with just aren't that educated in their field.) Then they vehemently deny its potential validity because it violates their pre-conceived notions," or because ""it's always been done this way""", but once the idea has reached a critical mass in the collective and they realize they are behind the times as it were, they begrudgingly accept the idea. Think about that for a while. A great example of that is the Catholic Church.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ			   How do you define ""incompetent""? Speaking from personal experience", my former district manager was a complete a-hole and nothing he ever did made any real difference in our workplace. He was my bete noire. Nobody liked when he came through the door because he was always super critical of every little thing. He wouldn't even let the cashiers have water to drink at their stations, for fear that someone would mess up our dinosaur computers (I shit thee not, 1985 software!), even though we technically weren't supposed to leave our area, which he really couldn't enforce because we usually ran a skeleton shift. He always made our lives difficult and seemed to have the nerve to think every one of us was incompetent. He continuously just made shit up to make himself feel important and to make sure we didn't get out of line. I hated following his arbitrary rules. Half the time we couldn't obey them even if we tried. I'm so glad I had an understanding store manager or else I would've been fired a long time ago, most likely for insubordination.

There are some who are judges, teachers, police officers, and they work within the rules and protect stability and structure in our society.

"ESTJ	Still", I hate stereotypes. If I know another ESTJ, it's either not as obvious as my dad or I just am not paying attention. Overall I'm not interested in pushing stereotypes onto other people.

Their sometimes black and white nature (not meaning to be offensive) is out of a need to create security and set boundaries. They need for things to be ""set"," and done a certain way.

"ESTJ	Not all stereotypes have to be negative", though. I'm an INFP and my husband is an ESTJ and some of the positive stereotypes are the things I value most about his contribution to our relationship: I never feel emotionally insecure with him because he is loyal, steady and dependable and always fulfills his promises and obligations. His emotional steadiness makes a nice bedrock foundation for me to anchor myself during flights of fancy or emotional stress.

"ESTJ	Unhealthy people of the same types are probably going to have the same negative qualities. This does not mean that all of the people of that type are as bad as the unhealthy ones you've come across. An unhealthy ESTJ will probably be too bossy", cold, selfish, and arrogant. An unhealthy ISFJ will probably be too clingy, dependant, and have a huge need to be needed, and selfish too. I'm just pointing this out. We all have flaws, and there are going to be people with stronger flaws than others. That should not change your view of everyone of a certain type. There are good people in every type. Types different from our own have strengths that we lack. Look for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She's 6 years old now and she is the most stubborn", charismatic, gutsy, rude, fun, troublesome and silly child I've ever known. She thinks she knows everything, she begins to teach you nonsensically and if I had to describe her in a few words they'd be. Presumptuous, manipulative, intelligent, and loving. I'm just hoping we can adjust our temperament enough to structure her in a healthy way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Poptart   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	***OP"," the only one I disagree with on your list is ""direct and truthful when communicating with others"". While they are often truthful and easy to read", their communication style can be indirect and they often imply things instead of stating them explicitly. For example, they may phrase a statement in the form of a question, and expect the listener to take it as a statement. The first instance that comes to mind is when my little brother eats with his fingers," my ESTJ father will say ""DO YOU HAVE A FORK!?"" instead of ""use your fork"". Bad example", but it is one of many.    I am having a first relationship with an ESTJ.  We have the hardest time communicting.  I try to read into what he is saying because in my experience his sentence says a whole lot of shit.  That I don'taddress because I don't want to go there.  I know I'mnot making sense. We have only been dating about 6 weeks.  Hopefully, more will be revealed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	My Phd supervisor is definitely an ESTJ. My stay in his lab has just been horrible for me. He cannot let me express myself in any way. HIS way his the correct one. Long list of some stupids things to do like ""ordering new shelf for the lab"""," ""organising some stupid non-scientific meeting"". When I try to discuss about scientific issues or present some draft to him", he just looks to the form," never to the bottom. ""some accent is missing there"," the new typographic rule states that you should put accent on capital letter"" (This is a french laboratory)", your picture in page X is not well centered. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	To my opinion he is a uncompetent scientist", just gathering arround him collaborators and partnerships that know how to do the job. He just do all the administrative stuff all the time, writing nice report to obtain grants etc... He his like  a project manager but absolutely not a researcher. the odd thing is that being like this, he just ruined my career as a researcher. He is absolutely unable to understand that people could think or behave in another way. The funny thing is that he is german and I am jewish, and that he he had several antisemitic remarks. For me an ESTJ is just like a german officer. Nice guy socially, doing all what the system expect him to do, protecting his familiy, adopting sofisticated and very conformistic behavior in public. But if something doesn't  belongs to his system, he think it must be exterminated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I don't agree with the the statement that"," ""ESTJ's are idiots""", they are just people who feel things very deeply and are hurt easily, and if it makes them feel good to listen to what society tells them, so what? Let them be happy. They have beautiful hearts, they have GOLDEN hearts, the reason that they have such a bad reputation is because of the vulnerability that comes along with trusting people/ yourself, and this is why they are so out of touch with their hearts. I'll admit, I've had more than a few clashes with my ESTJ dad, but over time I've come to realize that he doesn't realize he is being selfish, so how can I blame him and get angry at him for not listening to me/placing himself above me. By letting him get to you, you have lowered yourself to his level, don't do this to yourself. Remember, as hard as it is to accept," it's nobody's ""fault""", there is a cause for everything.

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Happy   Tell me what ESTJ stereotypes you have heard of. This is in no way an attack on ESTJ's. This thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the ESTJ personality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Here is my list of ESTJ stereotypes..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1.) Does not question the law",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2.) Conservative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3.) Bullies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4.) Unprogressive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	5.) Paranoid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	6.) Bias towards their own beliefs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	7.) Critical of others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	8.) Strict",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	9.) Boring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others.    As with everything in life that is stereotyped", I can at least see where they originated. But of course, stereotyping is just a lazy person's way of 'understanding' the world! I do like this list of stereotypes, however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	A close friend of mine is an ESTJ", and an old teacher of mine also was. They definitely displayed some of these traits to a degree; these clearly displayed traits were being critical of others, and being direct and truthful (or, blunt). In terms of criticism of others, these two people will let people know if what they are doing is against the ESTJ's moral values, or against the values or emotions of someone the ESTJ held close, or if there was an element of injustice. In this way, the stereotype of 'bullying' in my eyes is perceivable, but perhaps incorrect; ESTJ's might seem like bullies when their rags are pulled, but will in fact be trying to support morality, happiness, and most of all, justice and fairness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The bluntness has always made me laugh; I like it when people are blunt with me. I believe ESTJ's feel the only way forwards into true progression (of course", this is how THEY personally perceive what progression is) is to tell people the truth. This means, if you've pleased them, you will know. If you have good traits you will know. Naturally, this also counts for the opposite. ESTJ's in my experience don't like dysfunction. For everything to be in working order, an ESTJ will identify the problem, and hope the person has the initiative to sort it out! If the targeted individual is actually suffering or struggling with something, this may come across as insensitivity and bullying- but I feel that the original aim was to improve standards for everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The more I read of this", the more I feel you're describing Bill O'Reilly! Hah, ahhh...that crazy bastard might not think he's far-Right, but the Tea Party are still handing him biscuits over the fence...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	But I digress. I feel ESTJ's do have a habit of being unswaying in their beliefs", but let's face it- everyone, of any type, race, religion, or creed, is ultimately unbending in some areas. Perhaps ESTJ's just tend to be a little more so. Is it bravery? Is it arrogance? Who knows! For those that I know, I accept it as part of their nature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Now the last part is...boring?! Ahahah...fuck man. You need to come over and have tea and biscuits with my ESTJ friend and I some time. At the end of the day", your massively increased knowledge of the Cold War, Communist Propaganda, Ancient Greece, Disney Movies and what type of biscuits to have next will PROVE that they're not boring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ESTJ...it s good to have one at home!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Drawbacks:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-They can be annoying and abusive when you disagree with them. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	How to avoid conflicts with ESTJ:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-pretend you share their point of view but do things your way", never argue, it s pointless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- if you say", 'ok' and then do something your way  they will spend the whole week trying to comprehend why they did  not double check, but will finally come to some  awkward conclusions like: 'no one else know how to do stuff, apart from me!' or 'next time i'll do it myself to be sure it s done right'!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ESTJ seem not to follow rules", they seem to make rules and apply them to other people! lol I find people say ESTJ follow the rules but like i said only if it abides by their standards of the 'rules'. They get angry when you can prove them wrong  ... thats right i went there lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Ashleyshrugged   I'm sure there are plenty of people in this world that don't like me because of my personality type", but in my case I've found the key factor is weather people are F's or T's.  Every single one of my friends is a T.  My husband is an INTP," which actually works out incredibly well.  He sort of needs someone to ""do the things he doesn't like to do""", like planning and cleaning the house, and I really need to have someone who listens to me and gives me great advice, he is great at creating a big picture plan, and I'm good with the details.  Now F's on the other hand, I can barely understand you guys.  It really stinks because 75% of women are F's," so most of my friends are men.  I do have a few girlfriends but many of them just have a hard time with how I will basically tell it like it is and I'm not very concerned with their ""feelings"".  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I think that lots of F's take everything I say too personally", I'm generally not trying to offend them.  Think of Dr. Tempe Brennan on Bones, she just says things that are true sometimes even if others find them insensitive, I can't even understand why people would be offended by my pointing out the truth about something...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	A few things stood out to me as being atypical of an ESTJ.  First of all", you're too abstract for an S.

Your tangents on yelling and the dilemma on whether or not to give aid to Africa are two examples of inductive logic--expounding on a smaller example into the larger issues involved.  Inductive logic is often preferred by Idealist/NF's, as is your focus on relationships and people.  Guardians (SJ's) prefer linear ways of thinking which would avoid taking on such tangential topics.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Moreover", Guardians don't often understand and get along well with NT Rationals (e.g. your husband), and, though of course two mature individuals of any temperament make a successful marriage work, SJ/NT marriages tend to be fraught with misunderstandings and an inability to relate to one another which makes mutual satisfaction difficult to achieve.  If you are finding things work out splendidly with your NT husband, and without much effort, then I question your personality test results. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	David Keirsey (also an INTP", btw, like your husband) studied the Myers Briggs and found several weaknesses.  In particular, he found that Myers-Briggs test is not very accurate in terms of measuring N vs. S.  I would recommend that you take the Keirsey temperament sorter and see if you get the same results as your MB test.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Moreover", I would add that NF Idealists (I am one myself) are more prone than any other temperament to get false results on personality sorters.  Besides the flaws of the test, we are too good at understanding what the question is getting at, and too self-effacing to understand ourselves in terms of absolutes.  I took MB three times and never got an accurate result.  The first result said I was ISFP, the second ESFJ, and the third was also a Guardian.  But I am an ENFP, no doubt about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I believe you regarding the E and J", so I would likely peg you as ENFJ.  It's funny that you think of the world in terms of T's and F's and I think you are an F yourself.  But perhaps the T/F difference that you are referring to is actually the N/S dichotomy. According to Keirsey, about 80% of the population is S, consistent with your breakdown of 75% of women being hard for you to understand.  Keirsey pins the N/S dichotomy as the most important one for temperaments--the one that breaks the world down into groups of people you understand vs. groups of people you don't understand.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	N's are the abstract folk--the one's who can take an idea and get so fully absorbed in it that they can lose awareness of their surroundings.  It would be easy to think of N's as thinkers in that way.  But the T/F dichotomy refers only to the subject of interest: T's prefer to think about things", F's prefer to contemplate people, relationships, etc. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Keirsey's book Please Understand Me II is wonderful", much more clear and compelling than his website, although the website is also good.  He helps clarify many of the misunderstandings caused by Myers-Briggs mistakes and clear up much the confusion as to who we are and why we do what we do. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	BTW", if you are an ENFJ married to an INTP, you would be in what Keirsey found empirically was the best sort of compatibility within marriage--same with regards to N/S, complementary in every other respect.  He found these sorts of marriages--Idealists/Rationalists and Guardian/Artisan--were more successful than any other matches. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Also", Kathy Reich, author of Bones and creator of Tempe Brennan's character, is also an idealist. A lot of writers are. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Which brings me to my final point", the length of your post.  Idealists are so long-winded!  Sorry to all the pithy S-folks out there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	As an INTP", I know damn well a lot of the types tend to not like us much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	And all but one of those are perfectly content with recognising this in their own ways", when healthy, and just not interacting with us in any way unless they HAVE to due to work and us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Yep. You guessed it. Your type is THAT one. And", let me fuck your shit up something fierce. An INTP would rather die than obey you unconditionally. Humans are not psychic. INTPs are, by nature, the first to question everything and anything. So, when your obvious God Complex triggers and you expect all humans to psychically know how you expect a problem to be solved, exactly, and when you expect all humans who don't GET YOU to capitulate, us worthless piece of shit INTPs who flip you the bird and carry on as we do are so fucking frustrating to you types.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	One major advantage you have over us is the power of numbers. The other? The Power Of Authoritarianism. You manipulate", and fuck, in your masturbatory world, you FORCE us to obey. But did I not say that we'd rather DIE than listen to your shit unconditionally?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Accuse me of type bigotry all you'd like. But all other unhealthy MBTI types", when they act like total shitheads, the CAUSE is them being unhealthy, and the EFFECT is dependent on their type. With  ESTJs, though, I really think the cause is being an ESTJ," and the effect is becoming unhealthy because some important people don't unconditionally capitulate to you. I am more than willing to take infraction points or a temp ban for saying this. I have NEVER met an ESTJ who I'd consider ""healthy"," and doubt I ever will.
ESTJ	They can get angry at others for them not seeing it their way.

It's hard to make anything more than a superficial assumption made off of one picture but you have the initial appearance of a quasi-artsy type.

I would imagine a ESFJ to dress very neat but conservatively, if we're speaking in stereotypes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	FYI--Myers Briggs test is flawed.  It gives a lot of false results.  The first time I took it", it told me I was an ISFP.  The next time, an ESFJ.  I am neither--I am ENFP.  For all the people who are on here, thinking that they are S's, but find themselves oddly behaving like N's--PERHAPS YOU SHOULD DOUBT YOUR TEST RESULTS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Keirsey's temperament sorter is more accurate than MB", and his theory is the only one I've seen that has been researched and supported with empirical evidence.

"ESTJ	-My mom-in-law is ISTJ and she is among the most caring individuals I have ever met. She gives so much of herself to others", offering 200% in any situation, ready to help anyone who needs it. When we are with her, her meals are always on time, and delicious, wholesome, great salad dressing (who has time to make salad dressing anymore??). So her jokes are shallow--I have learned more from her about how to take care of my family and myself than I have ever learned from any NT intellectual's discourse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Most ESTJs would not be on this forum because they are too engaged in the world around them; too engaged with their duties", chorelists, responsibilities, etc. A lot of the stereotypes people are making here are half-true--yes, they are unyielding--but no, that doesn't make them all assholes. There are several situations in life in which being unyielding is a very good thing--i.e. giving someone who needs it a good kick in the pants. Many N's (who dominate these boards) would not appreciate said kick-in-the-pants, but a lot of folks--SP's especially, who account for up to 40% of the population--love it when someone cares enough about them to deliver it with force. Another thing SJs tend to be great at is making life run smoothly, on time, making sure there is milk in the refrigerator, etc. Without SJs, we would all surely perish, our society would malfunction like a printer machine just when you need it, us lost and languishing in our own distracted creativity. Like other good folks have pointed out, the goodness or badness of a person--their level of maturity--has NOTHING to do with temperament. There are good and bad versions of ANY temperament. While temperament friction certainly exists, maturity is what allows us to see beyond these stereotypes, into the reality of the person across from us.  Close up, we are the same, doing the best we can with what we have been given. ,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	So from cognitive functions theory I'm going to say the idea of ESTJ ~ traditional and all that is crazy", and that they can fit a lot of what is often associated to INTJ.

"ESTJ	ohhh and another good example is that people from school who are all ""no rules or work just party beer drugs and sex!1111"" make me roll my eyes to a stratospheric extent. i have to be really tolerant around them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I'm not sure where all this ESTJ~leader comes from. If it comes to being Te-dominant", that wouldn't imply leadership. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am so sick of the whiny people coming onto the ESTJ/ISTJ forums to whine about something a supposed STJ did in their life. I think most ESTJ stereotypes stem from the fact that people often mistype people they dislike as ESTJs. It is very difficult to type most people", because you only see a certain part of them. Even if one is very assured in their ability to type someone, it doesn't mean that they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Yes", I would agree that STJs are the more matured out of all types. In my opinion, it is because these people are immature, that they must come on here to rant about a problem we can't fix for them. Of course not all STJs are mature, it is all different depending on the person. Seriously people. You will save a lot of time talking to the actual person about your problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Happy   Tell me what ESTJ stereotypes you have heard of. This is in no way an attack on ESTJ's. This thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the ESTJ personality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Here is my list of ESTJ stereotypes..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1.) Does not question the law",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2.) Conservative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3.) Bullies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4.) Unprogressive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	5.) Paranoid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	6.) Bias towards their own beliefs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	7.) Critical of others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	8.) Strict",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	9.) Boring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others.    Sums it up nicely. :-P Really though", each person will have deviations from this, so it is not absolute. Heck, most of my test end in a near 50/50 P/J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Was reading through this thread due to my curiosity of ESTJs. I haven't encountered one in person yet", or at least not to my knowledge...I don't typically like typing people I know. However, would any of the ESTJs on here know if it is common for other ESTJs not to be interested in mbti? From what I've read on this website and others, I get the feeling that some of them wouldn't see the point in taking the test, or spending a significant amount of time on it. Is that why I haven't come across another ESTJ yet (that I know of)? Do you guys find that it comes up in conversations a lot with people you know, or would you rather talk about more imporant topics? Just curious :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I'm an INFP and I frankly couldn't care less if ESTJs pretend to not like me because I realize that they don't even understand themselves that they really do. I make them laugh unexpectedly", I amuse them, and I entertain them. As much as they want to believe that the INFP is everything against what they stand for, they need to just come right out and tell us that they actually love everything about us and didn't think they could ever feel this way about anyone. If the puzzle fits...stop being ridiculously cold, cruel, and logical and admit that you're attracted to people nothing like yourself and you can both be real about it because that's the level you connect on anyway. The level of getting REAL about life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I don't get the negative stereotypes here- sure", they're demanding and bossy, but they get the job done. Yeah, they're blunt, but isn't that good? I know an ESTJ friend and he inspires me a lot. And he's nice too. It's just that he didn't show it to everyone and he didn't do it often. I know he's a good guy inside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Yes", he is quick to get angry, but he blows off quick, too. Once he told me that he had problems being perceived as aggressive and too serious, and said he wanted to be fun and easy-going like my other friends. He liked the control, sure, but this proves (well in my case) that ESTJ's aren't all about power and commanding respect. They wanna have fun too, but they're also serious when they need to be. We talked around and it was clear that he had principles, and that's very admirable. He reached the conclusion that he won't change just because other people wanted him to or because he wanted to be perceived differently. He knows what he is, and he'll stay true to himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I've observed that a lot of the negative stereotypes came from many F's and that's understandable.

"ESTJ	HI. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ESTJ here. This is actually my first post on P-Cafe. I've realized that we are extremely underrepresented on MBTI discussions and it has led me to join. It's a shame to see so many almost exclusively negative stereotypes on here about the ESTJ. We're not all a bunch of hardened", inconsiderate authoritative doms who lack emotion. I never raise my voice and have never been violent. I consider myself a doer and a dreamer (although probably more of a doer) and although I/we can be very career-oriented, I/we frequently go out of my way to try to help others. I am a professional musician - very unexpected of ESTJ stereotypes - and I devote my life to artistic and interpersonal pursuits. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Gah", okay, I'm trying not to get defensive, but all this crap really bothers me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I personally find most of ESTJ's boring", but I have know some exeptions. My friend for example, might be rather funny with her other-people-focus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It is true", that they're often obsessed with rules and not breaking them. That's what fires my rebellious spark, changing the system even in a very small way. I don't want to sound like an unique snowflake, but other people can't make me, I value my freedom above all, and ESTJ's behave as if they want to be ruled. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Not every ESTJ is like that", but they all have some similiar features    Just a thought, if we're to take MBTI seriously, is all this negative typist stereotyping any better than say, racial stereotyping? We're painting a very negative stereotype of ESTJs, which is only possible because there are not many here to defend themselves but, as you can see, many of them are saddened by how they are portrayed and often break the stereotypes as individuals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I'm betting on the latter in this case.    If i believed the stereotypes", I wouldnt be asking him to explain it to me. I wouldnt have asked in the first place. Accepting at face value does not really explain to a person why its right or wrong. In fact its not wise to accept things face value. I never fully accept things face value and I always question or look for information. I could be wrong in understanding, or my experience could give me the wrong conclusion because I fully do not know the person or type. Its a fault in our types as INFPs, taking things at face value. Sometimes its good and okay but it is not the wisest approach. Why? because then you will not be able to explain in a logical and rational way why its not acceptable to others so they can understand and either agree or disagree. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	That can be read two ways in fact. It depends on the tone of the person too and its why online words do not translate well in terms to others. Im asking with sincere aspect of understanding because i see all this stuff about ESTJs and it contradicts and it feels wrong too. I want the truth and closure so I am asking from the source. I can understand if you feel protective of them but I do mean no harm. You shouldnt be so judgmental of people like that. Its not understanding English because again you assume I know what you mean and what you are talking about.  What does it mean to be good at English in your eyes? Because people have different takes on it. Like I do not even know what ESL means. As an INFP", i think I would not question what I believe in correct? I believe in children and consistency, especially with honor and words. I do not feel a need to question this. Yet here I am questioning these stereotypes that pop in my mind when I hear ESTJ and when I read people's words and on google. Its annoying. SO," I am asking for answers. I can understand how that sentence can mean ""Well i think it is so you should prove to me how it is not."" But I did not mean it that way to which I apologize. If you do not believe me or want to say I am this and that so be it. But I know what I am asking and I really should not have to explain that except to an ESTJ (since the question is directed at them).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes, I need the help of others and if they aren't doing anything and are just standing in the way, I tend to get very impatient.    To answer the first one, I find it okay. Because im actually coming here to see and disprove it. I mean all I see and hear is how they are this and that and like I said I dont like to take things face value. Google gave a gist of how you are but it doesnt explain function fully and how you see the world, behave and think. I want to know that and I love learning and reading on it. I mean I used to think SJs would be a hazard to me based on the general descriptions from mbti. But really its all in the functions like Isabel said. And I mean I had bad run ins with ESTJs before excluding one. I often felt they werent patient enough with me but again it could just be me and my OCD. So I wanted to disprove it on here due to no help from any other source. or the other sources were and are unreliable. I also wish to understand how that is unacceptable towards you too. So I dont repeat it and keep it in mind when I reflect and stuff. I mean I knew you had Te and Si but I didnt know of the other functions. Like you said about seeing the world differently, I function differently. I ask vague questions and its hard for me to specify it without first thinking of the question for a bit. I mean I dont hate you guys im just getting sick of the air people are breathing out and want to find the pure one. By you disproving the judgmental conceptions, I am able to learn what is really true of you than forced to rely on what others say. Who better to know than an ESTJ themselves?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Hmmm i understand you just want to finish the task at hand. What if someone wishes to double check so its done correctly? Like in nursing school we are taught that sometimes and often its important to double check what you check off write", calculations etc for the patient. And i mean like reading those, to me its like a fail-safe in case what we do does not work or is enough ya know? Cuz stuff does not always go as planned. And I mean being stressed over something like that yes, I can definitely understand why you are upset. But also a part of me is saying, perhaps you couldnt have finished in time or they forsaw it because of the external things that played into the situation and you did not? These are possibilities that pop in my head when I read things people say. Like theres often a reason for it even if you dont see or understand it and its okay to ask questions and etc.  Lol the unicorn.......maybe he was doing it to relax? Or something. Art can be releasing to a person and origami does take a while to do. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Overall I getcha and understand and I agree to a certain point. But because im me and function differently id say to sometimes consider maybe its not what you think? And ask about it. Like the origami thing. Id be interested to know why he was doing it and if its wasting time especially. If im making you upset or anything by this tell me I dont want to hinder on your thoughts and feelings this is jsut my take and perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I do want to know if any of that is true......O.o    Open-mided. Well", for a start, as someone said, Ne makes us open-minded. Also, I'd say that Te is kinda open-minded. From what I've understood, the extroverted functions are open-minded while the introverted are close-minded, though in their own area. Say Fe is a lot more open-minded when it comes to values and such than Fi," and Te a lot more than Ti when it comes to ""new"" logic", since we take it from the outside. <- That is pretty bad explained, but it's what I got atm. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Pinina   Open-mided. Well", for a start, as someone said, Ne makes us open-minded. Also, I'd say that Te is kinda open-minded. From what I've understood, the extroverted functions are open-minded while the introverted are close-minded, though in their own area. Say Fe is a lot more open-minded when it comes to values and such than Fi," and Te a lot more than Ti when it comes to ""new"" logic", since we take it from the outside. <- That is pretty bad explained, but it's what I got atm. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Impatient. As it", with Ni PolR, does make some sense, as in we want to do things now, and prefer not waiting. Also in the sense that we want results as soon as possible.

Personally, I think ESTJs are the most badass. Yeah, I get how people think ISTxs are badass because they're loners, but to me, a badass is an extroverted soldier type who doesn't give a fuck about your ideals and just wants to tear down all false realities because he seeks the truth.

"ESTJ	For example", this is excerpt from the description of weak Te.    This person easily believes in facts and figures, often turn a deaf ear to everything but these. Keeps to places where he knows what to do in every situation. Suggestible by the external order of things, which is often the order that was in place during his upbringing: the political system, social norms, etc. Always moves in the direction of highest order and carefully avoids chaos, is inspired by this order and worries that in future it might change. Knowledge of the facts of the situation often replaces true understanding of the underlying problems. Understanding becomes superficial, simply a collection of surface data and statistics, laws and regulations. He does not like long and detailed explanations," will immediately interrupt and say: ""So what is this in actuality?"". He wants to get a working solution or order right away", not the rationale behind it. Likes terminology, you can sometimes talk to him only using some accepted terms and this will be sufficient. Especially gets influenced by the facts that he sees with his own eyes or can touch with own hands. Thus he can fall victim to scams that provide specious claims and facts," especially if the scam is done out in the open (""simple dexterity of hands and no tricks"").",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	You do realize that you are being very mean to large groups of people", right?    I beg to differ. That region has a lot of problem with racial tensions. At least Sweden and Denmark. In Denmark, for instance, one commentator made some nasty remarks about Senegalese players and was never booted for his remarks, during a game they had. Several were tried for raping Iraq civilian women in the Iraq War (Denmark was on in a quintet of nations that invaded Iraq, along with US and Britain). And contrary to what some said, they don't hide their racism. In fact, Swedes, Danes and Israelis (whether they're racist or not) are all open about how they feel about other races.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Denmark", for instance, one commentator made some nasty remarks about Senegalese players and was never booted for his remarks, during a game they had. Several were tried for raping Iraq civilian women in the Iraq War (Denmark was on in a quintet of nations that invaded Iraq, along with US and Britain). And contrary to what some said, they don't hide their racism. In fact, Swedes, Danes and Israelis (whether they're racist or not) are all open about how they feel about other races.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Sorry everyone", I realize I am yet another non-ESFJ posting on this thread, but I just can't understand why there is so much negative connotations toward the personality type. One of my very best guy friends is an ESFJ, and by that I mean he could be the poster child for the personality type. He is the friendliest, most charismatic, most gregarious, generous, loving, genuine, self-sacrificing soul I know. He will sacrifice almost anything for others, even those he does not know well, but especially for those close to him, most of all family. He has said to me many times," ""people are more important than anything else. Ever. People are always most important."" He uses this argument to rationalize staying up until 5 AM the night before exams and early classes time and time again", just to spend time talking to friends who need him. More often than not, when I see him he mentions how little sleep he got (usually 3-4 hours), and I ask him why he got so little, and the answer is always that he was spending time with friends or family. Sometimes I worry about him because he neglects his own health so often for the sake of others. I don't see how such unconditional love could be construed as negative (except perhaps for the ESFJ himself when he does things for others that drain him and his health).,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I keep hearing people describing the ESFJ's as shallow. I wonder"," how many of those people really know an ESFJ beyond a casual acquaintance? I know my ESFJ friend very very well. Others in our large group of acquaintances/friends only know him as the ""class clown"" or the goofball", the life of the party. That is how he presents himself to people, trying to please and entertain everyone, and he succeeds in that, and some people would think he is shallow because of that, but that is only the surface of who he is. Having gotten to know him so well, I know that there is another side to him that he does not show to everyone. He likes to think to himself and he takes serious matters very seriously. He was depressed in middle school, and he consciously made the decision in high school to change his life, and taught himself to stop worrying so much what others think of him and to live his life so optimistically and for other people that he honestly now is a truly happy person. Anyone who can change his or her attitude on the world like that, through sheer force of will, can't really be shallow," can they? Are there any other of you ESFJ's who have had a similar experience? The thing with my friend is that he doesn't want people to know his past or that he used to struggle with depression. He asked me specifically not to tell anyone else we know about his experiences. He said ""people just see the happy-go-lucky me", and it's a lot easier when people just see that side of me, it's easier to make people happy," so can you just not tell anyone about any of this?"" I find it really interesting that he is the furthest thing from a shallow human being (he is the best listener", and honestly and deeply cares about the people he talks to, and does not take serious matters lightly at all), but he wants people only to see the bubbly," happy side of him because it's ""easier."" Are all ESFJ's that way? I mean", of course there are legitimately shallow people in the world, but this ESFJ is not one of them, and I suspect most are deeper than they seem on the surface.,,,,
"ESFJ	To be honest", I think ESFJ's are what this world needs. We need more people who genuinely care about the people around them and are charismatic enough and friendly enough to help and make people feel better about themselves. The only negative side of my relationship with my ESFJ friend is that I tend to live more in the past and get attached more strongly to things," while he lives for the present and ""blooms where he is planted."" I have a small", close circle of friends while he considers everyone to be his friend. This isn't usually a problem (I enjoy how friendly he is with everyone; it draws me out of the introverted bubble I would otherwise be in, even though I do actually like people), except that I am now living approximately 1600 miles away from him, and while I rely on consistent communication to feel like I really have a healthy friendship, he doesn't need that communication the same way I do. He expects to come back in a year or two and find his relationships the way he left them, while I have very little faith in such an optimistic outcome without the effort of constant communication in the interim. Regardless, he is one of the most reliable friends I have. I always know I can count on him. I just wish he would remember that he can count on me too, and let me do things for him.. he is always helping me and he hardly gives me a chance to return the favor! Every time I try, he always somehow twists the situation around and talks a bunch and smiles at me until somehow he's talked me into letting him do stuff for me instead. It's so aggravating in the most adorable way! :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I don't know that my insights are much help to anyone", as I myself am not an ESFJ, but I see them in a very very positive light, and I even wish I could be as genuine and generous and charismatic as these fantastic people are. The few I know (there aren't many, but they stand out) are absolutely amazing. I just don't understand why the term ESFJ has so many negative connotations on here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	I can't agree more with the "" Care about others even though the person has done wrong to them."" I have a couple friends who are ESFJ's and they both do the exact same thing. My two close friends who are both NFs have absolutely no problem being subtle about how they feel about one of them in particular", basically implying they think he has a low level of intelligence and that they really don't have much to say, even though he's not as dumb as he appears and definitely picks up on a lot of it. He also really desires to become closer to our little group of friends. I always want to at least socialize with him at least a little out of school to be nice, but fuuuuuuuuck, he seriously has nothing good to talk about. And this all coming from a sensor. You can now imagine how annoying it is to my NF friends, who also believe it is completely in their right to ignore and avoid anyone they don't like or appreciate. This of course always leads to them telling him we met up and had some fun without him, which visibly really hurts him. Despite this being a nearly monthly occurrence of his finding out we once again didn't invite him to something fun, he still talks to us as if nothing happened. I like my friends a lot, but they can be total assholes to others sometimes, makes me wonder why they even enjoy my company. Long story short, ESFJs are very nice and tolerating people, but me and them just don't mix.

"ESFJ	So I feel your pain :) *hugs*    Right here is a perfect example of the misinterpretation of the actions of Thinking types", specifically the INTP. I have direct experience from your point of view because one of my long time best friends is an INFJ, he was also my roommate. When we INtP's debate, or question something (which is all the time. If we aren't verbalizing it, we're doing it constantly in our heads, which is why we're quiet and observe all the time.), we are just looking for a truth, a better understanding of the world than we have had previously. We have a neutral stance until the facts say otherwise with no emotional involvement. We are not judging you as a person, it is not a personal attack," and are not trying to be right. When said a person will question ""why are you a hot mess""", we're wondering why you're getting emotionally involved, because we aren't. Why are you taking it personally? We aren't judging your worthiness. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	When you said you were irritated when we thinking types assume you can't use logic. This is incorrect. We think you just choose not to use it fully all the time and can't understand why. You often incorporate emotion. From what I read on the INFJ", they actively try not to hurt people's feelings, are uncomfortable with debate, and are extremely critical about themselves. This would explain the conflict between the two personality types. This issue has occurred many times and I Hope this cleared the misunderstanding of this occurrence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	2", 3)Yea! What you described was exactly what the other type that made me angry do LOL. They just started nitpicking on unimportant facts in the argument such as a typo I made (writing 'your' instead of you're) and started a whole argument over that! Then proceeded to 'teach' me how to use your and you're like how a primary school teacher would teach an year 3 child. While completely missing the whole point of the argument. I asked them to please stick to the overall argument and don't get sidetracked by picking out these little flaws, which made the proceed to call me a 'hot mess'. LOL the whole thing was very humorous tbh. and when I asked her to explain why she was making the accusations she was making, she didn't provide any logical explanations," all I got was a quote from a whole paragraph I have written and a line saying ""You just came across that way"". I didn't even know how to argue with someone like that", until I realized I wasn't the one being illogical, it was her. LOL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Ti is an INFJs tertiary function so when we need to utilize logic", I believe a well rounded INFJ is perfectly capable of that :) And I don't believe its just cause of my exposure to INTPs IRL, I think you guys are very easy to talk to in general because you are open minded, actually logical, and back up every point you make. Even if there is something I'm trying to say regarding feelings that would be hard to grasp, I find that there is an intuitive understanding at least so that also makes communication easier :) maybe I'm biased but INTPs are one of my favorite types haha both IRL and on PerC (function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8275656534393447,size:[0, 0],"id:""ld-3255-8133""});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s)","p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=""//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js"";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j",p);}})(window,document,script,ld-ajs);,,,,,,,,,,

Oh yes I know exactly how you feel about those phrases. Some people just need to understand that the F in our mbti basically means the things we care about are usually emotional related instead of physical or intellectual. But that doesn't mean we're all 'hot messes' that are easily wounded. A well rounded person should have a healthy mixture of feelings and thinking, and only then can we produce reasonable arguments. An extreme T would just be blunt and straight out without considering whether they've offended anyone or crossed the line," which is going to make their arguments come across as 'arrogant'. I was actually trying to explain this to the person I was debating with and she responded with something like ""don't get all emotional"," I'm just telling you the OBJECTIVE truth."" and no matter what I said", she wouldn't understand that I was just annoyed at her arrogance and attitude, it had NOTHING to do with my FEELINGS. I especially hate when they assume they're all OBJECTIVE... no one is purely objective, if you're giving me you're opinion, that is your SUBJECTIVE point of view. In my case, our argument was about her pointing out a flaw in my character that I didn't believe was true, but she labelled this personal opinion of hers as 'objective', so therefore every explanation I made was somehow me being 'emotional' and 'subjective'. I can't describe to you how unreasonable and stubborn she sounded.. it was painful to watch.,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mom is an ESFJ too, and it may often feel that way, but she's a really caring individual and I know she loves me and my siblings very much. If anything I think she's trying to...give some of her own input and try and give us something she feels we need in the moment, and bring us up better. Sometimes it's her way of trying to show us something we might have missed; she's opinionated and doesn't have the intention of hurting anyone however. It's hard for me to word it correctly right now, but to me it feels that it's her way of showing you matter more. At times she can be kind of tough love in regards to it seeming as though she's nicer to strangers. She struggles with the positions of having us be more independent, or being actively involved as a caretaker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mom has a habit of trusting people almost too much--a few years ago she was working on a job where she thought her coworkers were her friends, but they ended up stabbing her in the back. It's like, they're not friends, they're professional relationships. It's ironic, considering that an ESFJs Fe should be attuned to the differences between personal and professional relationships... yet sometimes I think you have a hard time being discriminatory...

"ESFJ	Not in as strong of a sense that the word implies. I would probably say more dissatisfied than anything", but instinctively optimistic. I'm not sure if it has to do with my type, but it's likely. Fe dominance draws me towards people and wanting to connect with them, so as much as I want and try to stay away, I always find myself crossing paths with people. The fact that it seems to be a natural impulse I can't evade makes me think it probably has relation to my cognitive processes as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Well", I'm not an ESFJ, but here are my two recent ESFJ sightings:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I went over to my ESFJ aunt's house for dinner. Every Christmas she makes the soup my grandmother used to make", which is my favorite food on earth, and this year I was in France so she saved me some in her freezer. We finished it off, then we went out for ice cream (my treat!), and altogether we spent 6 hours together, talking the whole time, and I was still sad to have to leave! Later this week: to the theatre to see the movie we both want to see and then out for Mexican food!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	My cousin in another state just got married this weekend", and her brother, an ESFJ, who I haven't seen in a few years, messaged me and said he missed seeing me there! We're sort of distant cousins and we haven't had much contact over the years but we're all the same age and have tons in common and I fit in with their family more than any other family I'm related to, and he's always gone out of his way to make and maintain a connection with me as if I were their long-lost sibling. I love this guy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Edit: one more:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Last September I saw my ESFJ friend at a large gathering. He got telling me something about something or other and to illustrate his point he started to say ""you remember at the festival this summer . . .""", paused," and he (not I) said ""oh", you weren't at the festival," you were at home in the US"". I was really impressed", because everybody who's anybody in our circle was at that festival, and most men I know who regularly encounter as many people as he does (I mean by the dozens and hundreds) do not remember who was what or where. He also remembered my name from the first time I met him and when introducing a small group of us to some other people at a later time he didn't even hesitate to recall my name. This guy remembers the personal details.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Most of the above describe my sister. She's the most giving", the most caring person I have ever known...so caring she makes me uncomfortable. Many times she has brushed my hair, patted it in place, washed my dishes, cooked me dinner...and she never have a need I can fulfill. BTW, she does this for all the family members, friends even strangers! I particularly like her detail planning skills especially when I'm planning for a trip...while I'm there in the clouds with this monstrous plan, spinning months even years into the future, she's busy taking care of my every detail in the present...and all this when she herself is time constrained with her family and budding career. Recently though she declared that she was tired of doing good to ungrateful people...and sure thing she has changed significantly. Not that I miss her taking care of me...I always wished she could stop pampering me. The problem is she's not the happy sister I used to know. Now she's obsessed with these grand schemes of becoming super rich, always cranky, too critical (not that I care with this but she has made my ESFP sister cry a number of times)...Is this normal with ESFJs? I mean does it reach a point you just withdraw from the very people you cared for, even do deliberate stuff that you know can hurt them? Damn I could be wrong but I get this idea that my sister is jealous of the siblings she imagine are doing better than her. I really adore her (one of the very few) and would like to understand her. Any ESFJ...anyone?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I think your sister is probably tired of trying to get the love and affection of everyone and not being appreciated for it. The thing about ESFJs is that when we do something we expect something in return (I know it sounds selfish). By something we do not mean the same act done for us", but rather love. Any act that shows love, it may be so small but it would mean the world to us to see that the other person cares. If we realize that they don't and if we close off completely we end up being that (critical, etc). I have a very bad habit of being like that with my younger sister, we just don't get along. I know its bad but at times I feel like I can't help it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	-eve    It sure helped eve91", thanks. I now see how important appreciation is for ESFJs. I must admit though it's a bit confusing because I used to try to do something in return for her efforts but she always made me think like she didn't want anything from me. I guess the two of us being so different must have made me miss the cues on what she would have really appreciated. After all my idea of a gift or appreciation might be completely alien or even off-putting to my sister...got to understand what she really might appreciate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	It sounds like she just wants people to show that they care/love her back. Maybe you should make it a habit to ask her about her day and how she feels about it (not the easiest thing for a INTJ", i know) Once she starts talking you'll get to the deeper stuff, and even if you don't, it might do her good if you show that you care about her feelings and worry about her (what you obviously do, otherwise you wouldn't have posted this.) Good luck!;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	My friend is like that and she is an ESFP", I mean that does not relate to me, if I don't get it I ask again or think what they said just so that I can understand and see if they need help, I hate it when my friends are sad so I try to help as much as possible!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	If she is saying something mean then just ignore it", she doesn't mean it, she probably just want her anger to go away, if she is mad cause of a coworker made her mad then she just doesn't want to hurt him/her, cause that coworker doesn't know her that well, but you do so she probably thinks its okay to scream at you, but she still should get some help to get rid of it. :P,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	So in the past year I have went through a huge deal of things that kind of shook me. Ever since then I haven't been the same; critical", judge-y, too OCD for my taste. I dwell on all the small details and can't seem to get over them. One of the things that has been bothering me is I always stress out whenever I go out with my husband. I need to make sure we go to somewhere new on our date night and look for new places every week. If it doesn't go according to plan everything suddenly gets ruined. I even keep on nagging on him to find somewhere new and romantic, but instantly assume that he has absolutely no taste and whatever he'll come up with is going to be terrible. I always feel like I'm missing out on something; the same thing happens when we travel together. I cant seem to relax and have fun. I then compare myself with other couples and end up blaming him for us being boring. Is is weird that I don't even know how to enjoy spending time with husband?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Any advice?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	@Jaime91  It seems to me that you are in need of control in regard to what you and your husband are doing on dates and holidays as a way of making up for a lack of control in regard to something else.

"ESFJ	My advise to you is to be open about your feelings to your husband", and let him know you are sorry for the way you have been behaving recently, because he really doesn't deserve criticism for being part of a couple that's not fun enough. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Thank you so much for that", it was eye-opening. You can say that I did lose control and I don't know how to get it back. How do you  think is the best way to get back to normal after such a thing? I mean, I want to stop trying so hard to make everything perfect and adventurous for the both of us. I want to enjoy spending time with him, and traveling with him to new places without the fear of not being able to to everything in that given city or place. I just end up dwelling on the fact that I'm the kind of person that simply can't have fun, you know?

"ESFJ	Any advice?    I had the same problem in my past relationship.  i went through something traumatic", and I just couldn't get back to the same me.  I am still not the same old me.  When things didn't go according to my plans in my head, I would feel everything was ruined too.  Sometimes I wouldn't tho, because I was trying to make us have a good time.  Those were the best of times, looking back.  I think you just need to focus on the fact that you can make anything fun, no matter how awful it goes.  When the moment happens where it doesn't turn out right, just decide that you can still make this a fun time for your husband.  Believe that you can make it fun, no matter what happens.  Try to be silly and cuddly and realize that those are the things that make spending time together so great. I'm preaching to myself here though, and I often don't follow my own advice, to my own peril.  I have such a hard time relaxing and having fun too.  I don't know if we will ever really overcome this, but we can overcome it sometimes by deciding that we will have fun no matter what happens beforehand, and continuously as things even fall apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My family is financially unstable .and im 19 years old in college right now . Today my mum told me "" i hope to have the next two years to live in harmony with you . I dont know how long i have left . Maybe less than 2 ."" She told me i didnt need to give her any money to support her old age because she wanted me to find my own future . but she said it would be a blessing if i could . I was crying actually because i feel so sad all along we never really got along well . But i wanted to ask what she meant ""by two more years ""? At first i thought she is keeping something from me . Like a sickness that she wont survive or something . But now im also thinking that she meant 2 years after i turn 21 because i have to fly my own wings  . I hope someone here can help to have some reassurance or open up my mind about this . I feel really sad now :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Originally Posted by DragonflyBlue   ok i need help my mom is an xsfj help me figure out if its an I or an E. i read a forum in the INFP section on mom's as ESFJs for INFPs and all of the descriptions fit her exactly. but here is the thing. she really dislikes talking to people on the internet. i have tried to get her to but she is not budging. she also really doesnt like talking on the phone either"," she says it hurts her ears. she loves to be around other people and is caring and funny. but i have asked her if she gets drained after a while of being around others and she said yes and said that everyone else does too its normal. i am confused is the an introvert as i see her or is she an extrovert. by circumstance we have been isolated for a long time so i have very little if anything at all to go by. all she does on the internet is play mahjong and solitare. she checks her email only to delete spam and read up on subscriptions. she reads the news but never talks and rarely looks anything up. she says that people on the internet are boring and pry into your personal life too much. she also is convinced that almost everyone on the internet are fakes acting like something their not. she won't barely believe a word you say on the internet. she loves helping others but being hurt a lot in the past she has a very pessimistic attitude about it believing the same thing will happen again. she takes a lot of things personally. she doesnt care what others think of her personality but cares about what others think of her in other areas like appearance. if some one who is with her looks bad she believes it makes her look bad too. is she an ESFJ thats just been isolated too long? or is she really an introvert? i read her the ESFJ description and she said it fit her exactly. but since she seems to be drain after a lot of social activity she may be an introvert even though she appears very extroverted around others. if we have been out a long time when we get home she often says ""im so glad to be home"" and seems relieved.    Remember there are percentiles as well.  It could be she's just barely an E or an I.  I'd have her take the actual quiz and see what percentile she comes out as.  Sounds barely extroverted to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	We are usually (like a lot of you have said) on a social web-site if we're on the internet.  I love this web-site"," but I'm not on it all the time.  I check it every now and then but not everyday.  For me personally I like to ""go do"" instead of being on the internet", but I still enjoy it when I'm not out and about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm an ESFJ and have searched the internet numerous times to trying to find ESFJ forums but to no avail. I'm not usually into forums and stuff but am really interested in Myers Briggs personality typing and speedreading etc. So I guess that's the reason I search for ESFJ forums and joined this cafe. Also I live with my INTP brother who frequently uses INTP forums from which he seems to get a lot of satisfaction from communicating with other INTPs. So that also spurred me to check out this forum business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	No fears", ESFJ here!!!!   I am fairly new to this site and did not even know my personality type until last week when my husband suggested that I take a test to find out.  The first test I took said I was an ESTJ, however after some self reflection and 3 more tests I found out that I am actually an ESFJ.  Three out of four test had the same conclusion.  My husband is an INTJ and has become very interested in all of this personality typing stuff.  So I decided to try per c out in hopes that I could relate to him better and learn some things about myself and other personality types.  So good," so far:)  Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.  We are not all too busy with our ""extrovertedness"" to have some intellectual conversation from time to time:)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	My ESFJ friend (even I think she's a bit I) is definitely on the internet much. She's not really interested in stuff like this though. She just took the test"," read about her result and moved on. ""Lol"," do you remember that? xD"" she said when I talked about MBTI a couple of months later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Yeah", as you said - chat rooms (that's where I found her), facebook...and a Harry Potter roleplaying game. She's a major book nerd/fiction geek and such. ^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	She normally says ""Bye for now", I going to be social now," have it the best! <3"" etc when she has to leave. And she talks a lot...but she is one great listener.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	My mother on the other hand...nahhh", not so much. Uses the computer occasionally, but never sits there for long. She needs to talk to people too much for that...and being in a family where everyone (INFP, ISTJ, IxTJ, ISTP (possibly," too depressed to tell. Definite I though) is introverted is not really that great for her. ""No one ever talks!"" I kind of feel bad for her", I wouldn't like living in a family where everyone is so extremely diffrent from me... Uhm, yeah, so going off subject a bit. Knows nothing about computers, craves answers really quickly. Forums would bore her. Uses the computer for facebook and paying rents. Pretty much. Wouldn't be interested in MBTI I believe. :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I think I'd go on more if other ESFJs went on more. (viscious circle?) As it is", there aren't many people to talk to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I get ESFJ a lot in tests", but I've never taken a proper MBTI test, so I can't say I am one for sure, but I thought I'd reply to this anyway!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I will admit that I am always on the internet", but this is probably because I used the internet a lot when I was in my teens as I didn't live near any of my friends - and now I just can't get out of the habit! As so many of you have said, that's probably why there aren't many ESFJs over here - because they're out with other people etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Again", I use the internet for a lot of social stuff. Email, blogging, Facebook...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I'm not surprised that so many ESFJs like chat", but I find it a waste of time as I want to get on with other things. They aren't necessarily things I want to do offline, but I might want to finish an email (despite the lack of immediate replies, I prefer the longer responses - you can find out more about a person). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	I could never stick to forums as I usually wanted to find out about something specific. Not posting much meant I didn't get to know the other members so I didn't feel like I was part of a community... There was only one I stuck to", because I got involved in a RPG of sorts and the other posters became some of my closest friends (and still are!),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	Anyway", I just joined this forum because I wanted to learn how to communicate better with other people with unlike types.  I know my strengths (caring, hospitable, etc...) and weaknesses (controlling, pedantic...etc..etc..) and I value my relationships with friends and family.  So, the more I learn about other's defaults, the more I can adapt my communication so I do not alienate anyone.  It helps me not be so neurotic sometimes.  That's all.  The end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After you get rid of the useless crapware they aren't emotionally attached to (all two or three of them)," they will thank you and call you a ""genius computer <guy/girl>"".

"ESFJ	Yeah", people tend to be real mean to ESFJs and ESTJs.  I can go either F or T.  Anyway, I've observed that other types tend to blame everything on their ESFJ mothers or ESTJ fathers.  They'll make negative stereotypes and lash out ONLINE about all the ESxJs in the world but would never do anything about it in REAL life. Sure, we SJs can me a quick decisions but I've noticed that other types are more condemning ONLINE than others.  I don't really venture out into other personality forums and stay within my ESFJ community hoping to find some type of encouragement or commonality, but I just find bashing by other types.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESFJ	keep the faith", ESFJs! <3    Thank you!  Yes I agree that the internet is more I and N dominated.  I think for a lot of ESFJs it's not enough S for us.  Also, for me, the internet kinda creeps me out.  I don't have a facebook account or anything like that.  I feel like if I wanted to find people, I would seek them out myself.  I dunno - just creepy to have my info all over the place.  Also I think the internet is not active enough.  I'm rarely on my computer (except at work) and the days that I am I feel like I get so lost and unproductive.  I think I personally need to be out and about doing things, seeing and touching people, etc.  That is what energizes me (hence ESFJ).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also seem as though they try to invoke a lot of arbitrary rules and accustoms from religion to social norms. Never met a young ESFJ so idk in that case.    That seems to be the case for the stereotypical SJ", I would say, though I don't personally know many SJs that are actually like that to such a hard line. The ones that do act like that are just assholes and certainly aren't representative of others. BUT, I do notice that the idea of order is certainly appreciated, and if religious doctrines or social norms can help bring about that idea of order than they certainly may be used and is why you might notice that a lot more. The ones you experience are probably pigeon-holing themselves into one way of doing things when, really, many SJs I know are open to a lot of new ideas (especially ESFJs it seems) as long as it maintains that sense of orderliness and structure. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know not everyone is as open minded enough - but rather than judging someone by their type, I like to explore and take it in and discover things about it rather than make generalizations (usually).  Everyone is so unique.  You can have 5 of the same personality type in the same room and all of them be quite different.

"ESFJ	Actually this is definitely an ESFJ thing to do. Personally I don't like to force anything upon people", but when I was younger I was very quick to give my opinion and to force upon people my beliefs of right and wrong, mostly where it was unwanted (even worse). You will probably see this with underdeveloped, immature, and even some adult ESFJs. It's unfortunate when adults act like pushy and controlling children and believe they're right all the time. Fortunately, a couple of years of maturing and much observation led to a better understanding of the way I acted and my personality in general. I'm deathly aware of these things presently, which helps me prevent myself from bad habits.

I read a lot of ""they're out socializing"" posts in the ESFJ forum and that makes me feel that I'm not as Extroverted as I would like to think because I don't like going out much. I like to socialize sporadically. I'll leave and spend the night at a family's house or friend for a few days and then I'm home for a while.

I actually like that about ESFJs. I know that I have a tendency to disappear for long periods of time, and one thing that ESFJs are good at is keeping people connected. In other words, just because I disappear, it doesn't mean I want to be like that. It's a weakness introverted intuitive types have. Avoiding dealing with problems is a maturity issue, not an INTJ trait. I deal with my own problems and then with a whole bunch of other people's problems. I'm a lawyer. ;)   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rest of the time, I'm on Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook, and other social sites. I do like reading things online (like interesting articles about MBTI or news articles), so it's not all social. In terms of message boards, it's not that I don't like them; it's that between all the other stuff I'm doing on the internet, I usually forget about what I posted and never follow through with responding to other people's responses unless I get email reminders about them.

Really? I would think that the difference between Fe/Fi would be too strong to ever to cause a mistype between the two.

Yes, we are very social.  I would much rather talk to a friend, my child," my husband(INTJ) than sit here on this computer ""chatting"" with anyone.  I don't play online games.

"ESFJ	I've said it before", and I still believe it -- I personally think there is an IN bias. I've had friends both online and in real life claim valiantly they are INTJ, just because they're smart and don't like partying 24/7 (I go to a science and engineering heavy school and literally everyone thinks they're INTJ.  That environment naturally breeds personality traits normally associated with INTJ, but does not INTJ make you). Most people who are frequently online would view themselves this way too. Heck, I first got INTJ when I got into MBTI, and for years I thought it fit quite nicely.    Since most ES would be outside dealing with auctual people vs being stuck in front of a screen 24/7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heck, I first got INTJ when I got into MBTI, and for years I thought it fit quite nicely.    Totally can relate to this. I have a sis who swears that she's an INTJ, but anyone with even a basic understanding of MBTI can see that she's otherwise. Very emotionally driven, relies heavily on past experiences to predict future events, she can't give me one particular example of her Ni while I can give plenty of her Si, which I'm betting is her Dom or Aux. Ti/Te is either Tertiary or Inferior 'cause it sure isn't well developed. I think she got her answer from a single free online test and looked at a quick Wiki search of the type afterwards. You can't rely on that. It's poor research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESFJ	Really", I'm just saying this because I see no way she could've come to that conclusion after meticulous research and reflective observation. I think she's at the conclusion that intuition = intellect, which also is just a result from poor knowledge. I'm not going to pretend that I'm an expert in MBTI, I just think that she doesn't value the system as much as I do, and therefore doesn't care much for accuracy.
