"ESTJ	Being an ESTJ", I've got some stereotypes that I'd like to debunk:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1. ESTJ's are boring because they play by the rules.Totally incorrect. We respect the rules", but that doesn't mean we don't play our butts off. I mean, serisouly, when you play by the rules, you're bound to have more fun when you win, because you did it fairly and without any extra help. Part of my philosophy: work hard, play hard. We ESTJ's may play by the rules, but if there's a loophole, you can bet we'll find it and exploit it! hahaha2. ESTJ's are bossy.This isn't necessarily true. Sure, we can come across as domineering and/or demanding, but it's usually because the people we're dealing with are completely incompetent, or they're shirking responsibility. One thing that I hate (and I'm guessing other ESTJ's do, too)," is irresponsibility.3. ESTJ's are ""penny-wise and uber-pound-wise.""This also isn't necessarily true. I have the tendency to be fairly lax with money. I work to make it so I can spend it on things that I want. That's the point of having a job", right?What do you think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do the words 'anger' and 'abusive' somehow come close to the definition of the ESTJ type for you (or even the stereotype)? If they do, they shouldn't. Those are words describing a mentally unhealthy individual, not the good portion of everyday humanity that ESTJ and similar types represent. Any individual with problems can be agressive, passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful, from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between. An ESTJ who accepts himself and learns to live with his own weaknesses will never be abusive or angry by simple definition, no more than an INFP or any other introverted feeler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	IXXP types are the ones which give the most frequent examples of passive agressive behaviour. An ESTJ would much more likely be outright agressive to the face of anything they find aggravating. They would sooner try to domineer a situation than try to undermine it passively. Their nature is such", they confront what they dislike directly, they don't accept situations they dislike and later fight them in a war of passive agressive attrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Though", of course, I'm only stereotyping from my own experience. My INFP mother, aunt and best friend are quite the artists of passive agression when they need to be (like today apparently..... ffs.).

My ESTJ grandfather, on the other hand, just tends to yell at things that anger him and tries to pull in connections with old friends to get someone he doesn't know fired.    All my statements are only based from my own experiences as well and unfortunately all the male ESTJs I have met are either abusive physically or emotionally.  Every ESTJ I know is extremely passive aggressive; way more than any ESTP, ESFP, INFP, ISFP, or INTP I know. So for example; if an ESTJ was to be abusive towards another individual it would most likely be behind closed door, while an ESTP wouldn't care as much who it's around. If an ESTJs values are threatened and an INFPs values are threatened, in my observations the INFP would less likely care about getting angry and yelling in front of a huge crowd of people than an ESTJ would. ESTJs are less straight forward when it comes to conflicts; they want to save face at whatever cost," so they wait until they're in the domineering position and cannot be threatened by outsiders to lash out on their victims. That's pretty passive aggressive in my opinion. Of course I do agree with your statement of ""Any individual with problems can be agressive", passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful," from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between."" I just stereotype ESTJs and ESTPs to be the most abusive.

He sort of needs someone to ""do the things he doesn't like to do""", like planning and cleaning the house, and I really need to have someone who listens to me and gives me great advice, he is great at creating a big picture plan, and I'm good with the details.  Now F's on the other hand, I can barely understand you guys.  It really stinks because 75% of women are F's," so most of my friends are men.

"ESTJ	I think that lots of F's take everything I say too personally", I'm generally not trying to offend them.  Think of Dr. Tempe Brennan on Bones, she just says things that are true sometimes even if others find them insensitive, I can't even understand why people would be offended by my pointing out the truth about something.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It's also challenging to be a ESTJ female", because I want to be in control of situations but on the other hand I also want to be feminine and believe in a traditional female role for me in my family.  This can definitely be a challenge for me to balance.  Now about the stereotypes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-controlling - Yes", I am this way.  Especially when I think that others are incompetent, if someone has earned my trust and I'm managing them I will let them do whatever they want, but earning my trust isn't super easy.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Authoritarian -Yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Lacking in imagination (Yes and no", I'm good at coming up with creative solutions to problems," but I'm the kind to sit around ""imagining a different world"" like my INTP", or even one to be very artsy/creative.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Bullying - I am not a bully.  I don't pick on people or say mean things about them for no reason.  I may tell someone the truth.  For instance"," if someone is perpetually late I might say ""It would be helpful if you could show up on time""", but I don't just attack people because I think they're weak or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Overly Competitive - Not really", I like to win, but I lose pretty well too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Can't Admit It When They're Wrong - I am addicted to finding to concrete truth", and I admit being wrong pretty easily, although usually I'll want some time on my own to think about things before admitting I was wrong.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Impatient -Very True",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Mainstream - I am very weird", especially politically, Although if it was 1776 I would be mainstream...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-A perfect example of Arthur Schopenhauer's quote: ""all truth passes through three stages: first it is ridiculed", second it is violently opposed," third it is accepted as self evident."" ...I don't really get what this is trying to say", am I the one who passes through three stages or is this what I'm supposed to think about others?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- I would say that we are pretty assertive", like what you see is what you get and if you are in trouble you'll know it   - I agree with this ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	- Not accepting of change  : I do not like change for no reason...I want to know why things are changing before I'll go along with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	-Willing to hurt others feelings if it means getting to the truth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Like to ""mother"" others (at least this seems true for female ESTJ's)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Very proud of accomplishments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	-Very loyal friends once someone has earned trust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	About Angry ESTJ:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I was a teen I had grown up in the kind of household where people yell and scream at each other every day.  As a result I also had an anger management problem.  I had a hard time dealing with conflict in any way and would often end up yelling or getting mad.  At some point I decided I had crossed a line and decided to change.  I gradually learned to control my anger and I can't think of a single time I have yelled or screamed at anyone since I've been at an adult.  If an ESTJ you know is yelling at people it is because they can't see how much it is damaging themselves and their own lives", and they don't know how to deal with the intense emotions that we feel about things.  I believe in things incredibly strongly, my beliefs are not a passing fancy, they make up my whole person and each day I strive to make sure I'm living by them.  If you're brave enough, maybe you should mention to one of these friends that they're anger is mostly damaging them, not others, and that others lose respect for them when they get angry.  When I learned that, it was easy for me to change.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Also", yes we are selfish, actually I think all people are, but that's another story :).  It is incredibly hard for me to emphasize with the hardships of others if I don't know them personally.  I can only see rational arguments.  For instance, when I watch one of those commercials for dying children in africa I truly do believe it's sad....but I also cannot believe that blindly giving aid to them is the solution.  Clearly to me the solution is helping their country by bringing in industry, business, and jobs.  The way that the US was built.  Giving people bare necessities does not bring them into independence, it only makes them believe the way to get aid is by staying poor.  Call me insensitive, but the US didn't become the wealthiest country in the world by accepting charity, and I'm not sure we would have if we had had charity.  I'm not saying I don't like charities, but they are always the ones where people help themselves... like scholarships for academic excellence, or if I hear of someone who has escaped from Cuba and made it to the US, I want to take them in.  Anyway, I'm not saying that I can't understand the plight of sick children, but if we spent half as much money building up power plants in Africa as we did on feeding them, I think the difference would be more substantial and lead to the only life I can see as worth living, the one where you are financially independent.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Ok this was a really long post so If you made it to hear", bravo, and if not, O well :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Cookie Monster   I had a boss who fit the ESTJ profile spot on. I was terrified of her. She was very intelligent", but she had not people skills, was a HUGE micromanager, and would also gossip and get people she did not like fired. She rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. It  is sad to hear so many have had such painful experiences with this personality type.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I am sure that there are some admirable ESTJs out there", I just have not met any yet...it seems the bad apples just ruin the whole barrel :(    One of the only people I've ever had a long standing grudge with is an ESTJ. It didn't help that she was my boss at 2 different jobs and my sister-in-law. I could sense her irritation with me not being 100% perfect at my jobs," both I just started with no experience. She would let me know everything I did wrong even if I already knew and was correcting it. Every day she'd say ""You're killing me Sarah"," you're killing me."" Her way seemed to be the only right way she would even try to tell me how I should spend my money and what I care about. I always respected her and kept quiet because she was my boss and also family that I had to see out of work and did not want to create a rift. She couldn't respect my N", while she was very observant of everything around her she didn't like that I wasn't and that it was a problem. The last straw was her showing up unannounced ( I was asleep), accusing me of stealing company money, and demanding I write a check, when payroll was HER job and she put it in my account. No one has ever treated me so absurdly. She was although generous, hard working, would do anyone a favor, and loyal to her family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Its very easy to hold a grudge against any personality type. I know I for one have. However", it seems like I lot of you have had experiences with an unhealthy ESTJ, which although I am very sorry about that, is no excuse to generalize our type. My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Is possible that these ESTJ's you are having problems with simply dont know they're acting this way? Especially if they are family wouldn't you like a good relationship with them? We are extroverts", aka not good at listening, we're not always good at noticing when we do something that may seem offensive or controlling, and no we're not really that gushy. But I will tell you that we are complete suckers for those in pain, especially if it is because of something we said or did. It simply crushes us. All I can say is, I am way more of a softer person because my mom and sister (ENFP and INFP) both had the guts to tell me that what i was doing was hurtful to them. I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Believe me", I know a lot about being that mean bully that you all can see. But I never knew I was doing that until my sister flat out told me. We're kind of like the dog who barks really loudly and bares his teeth at you, but then will freely let you sleep on his stomach and guard you from all dangers once you've made friends. I have a chow dog and if you've ever met one, they're in particularly similar an ESTJ. I've never had a more loyal dog.

"ESTJ	Me", as lantern, here to do just that: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1.) Does not question the law - I guess so", but I don't mind doing the odd 'naughty' thing just for the sake of hedonism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2.) Conservative - Not really", quite liberal....not that into politics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3.) Bullies - Hell", no - not even near. Bullies need a whack round the head. I don't like unnecessary unkind words.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4.) Unprogressive - Uhhh....no....I'm a take-charge person. If something I want done I will do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	5.) Paranoid - Only if something really matters to me and I want a positive outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	6.) Bias towards their own beliefs - Yes", my cultural beliefs - I question some of my family traditions, I'm not rigid towards these beliefs, but there are some I hold true value to my heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	7.) Critical of others - Only if it's someone who is incompetent in their work", and their incompetence is affecting others not just me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	8.) Strict - Not really", I do like some routine but really appreciate flexibility - you've gotta live!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	9.) Boring - I don't believe I'm boring. I love to have fun", depends on who I'm with though, if I'm with work colleagues there's only so far I would go - got a reputation to keep. Outside of work, with my usual friends, I let my hair down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others - Yes to an extent", I say it in the most kindest way I can. Why fool someone you care about with a silly lie - when you know full well that they won't benefit in the long run?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Yes I am all polite and formal at first", depending on who I'm talking to - this to me constituents good manners - I don't feel comfortable talking about my personal life straight away - I have never met anyone who is immediately open with their life stories. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	IF I feel", have made the decision that I can fully trust someone I am OPEN....I don't give a bull's eye - I have fun, I have broken rules....I am not some stiff person who looks like I have a coin up my backside, I have my values and I stick by them such as loyalty and respect. I'm down-to-earth, I dislike hierarchy, I prefer talking to people who have no airs about them, I believe everyone is equal, we are all the same, we eat, drink and go to the toilet, get sick and everything else - we are all human. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I know an INFP and we don't share the same interests either but we got along pretty fine for the most part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Sometimes it's hard for me to understand him", but I try my best to let him give me the opportunity to understand him without his descriptions being detailed, I didn't want to ask too many questions while he was also depressed, so I decided to give him space and let him think for himself for a second while I'm always there for him! it wasn't intentional though that whenever he told me about how he felt when he was depressed, he told me to stop rationalizing how he feels. I didn't even know I was doing it but at the same time, I was all ears and talked to him for hours on end so he could feel better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	To add a note to that", not all ESTJs are like that. Some get along great and some don't despite of the ESTJ and the INFP differences. I do think that it was best that you let go of the friendship that isn't progressing or if she isn't understanding or is willing to but this experience shouldn't get you to think about ESTJs in general. Some friendships aren't meant to be, it was best that you moved on. I hope you're doing fine!   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	No", he just does that every flight that he takes so he isn't late because he has to drive 2 and half hours to get to the airport. And he likes to be at the airport 2 hours early. The flights are usually around 9 to 11 am.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Is possible that these ESTJ's you are having problems with simply dont know they're acting this way? Especially if they are family wouldn't you like a good relationship with them? We are extroverts", aka not good at listening, we're not always good at noticing when we do something that may seem offensive or controlling, and no we're not really that gushy. But I will tell you that we are complete suckers for those in pain, especially if it is because of something we said or did. It simply crushes us. All I can say is, I am way more of a softer person because my mom and sister (ENFP and INFP) both had the guts to tell me that what i was doing was hurtful to them. I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Believe me", I know a lot about being that mean bully that you all can see. But I never knew I was doing that until my sister flat out told me. We're kind of like the dog who barks really loudly and bares his teeth at you, but then will freely let you sleep on his stomach and guard you from all dangers once you've made friends. I have a chow dog and if you've ever met one, they're in particularly similar an ESTJ. I've never had a more loyal dog.    INFj's are your dual and match so I guess it makes sense that with a little effort you can learn to not only understand them but to also build a great relationship with them; they protect your emotions and you guard them...works out nicely, for the most part, I think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had a little streak of it when she was a little girl, but she grew out of it a lot time ago. She takes care of children who aren't related to her and keeps an eye over them, but in all the time that I've spent with her, I never felt as though it was domineering or pushy, she just cared for their well being. I can attest to her goodwill, especially in comparison to a lot of people I know. Perhaps she does it because she wants to be liked, but is that really so bad?

Only a few people will ever be able to admit to their faults and see themselves like others see them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It is not a bad thing", because in your group you have the understanding of each other, and you're the majority among personality types so you're considered normal by your peers. They won't see you as stereotypes but you will see stereotypes in us. There was once a psychology study done that proved everyone thinks in stereotypes about something.

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by s0ulsurreal   All my statements are only based from my own experiences as well and unfortunately all the male ESTJs I have met are either abusive physically or emotionally.  Every ESTJ I know is extremely passive aggressive; way more than any ESTP", ESFP, INFP, ISFP, or INTP I know. So for example; if an ESTJ was to be abusive towards another individual it would most likely be behind closed door, while an ESTP wouldn't care as much who it's around. If an ESTJs values are threatened and an INFPs values are threatened, in my observations the INFP would less likely care about getting angry and yelling in front of a huge crowd of people than an ESTJ would. ESTJs are less straight forward when it comes to conflicts; they want to save face at whatever cost," so they wait until they're in the domineering position and cannot be threatened by outsiders to lash out on their victims. That's pretty passive aggressive in my opinion. Of course I do agree with your statement of ""Any individual with problems can be agressive", passive agressive, and purposefully hurtful," from INFP to ESTJ and all types in between."" I just stereotype ESTJs and ESTPs to be the most abusive.    I find immature ENTPs the most abusive ", especially verbally. I have a abusive ESTJ father but I think his abuse is not based on his being an ESTJ. He's not a healthy ESTJ so I can't go blaming it on his ESTJness. An unhealthy personality will be abusive or manipulative because they aren't in the right mind frame.

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by kept81213   Its very easy to hold a grudge against any personality type. I know I for one have. However", it seems like I lot of you have had experiences with an unhealthy ESTJ, which although I am very sorry about that, is no excuse to generalize our type. My dad is an ESTP for example and he is a huge jerk, but I would never generalize his type because I know plenty of other ESTP's that are amazing individuals. My stepmom, also not a very good person, is an ISFJ, but again, that is her and not her type. In particular we are probably the most misunderstood by NF's because they are the ones we simply do not have as much in common with. My mom is an ENFP and my grandfather is an ESTJ and I know she misunderstood him for a very long time. It really wasn't until she had me that she could really appreciate him as a person. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Is possible that these ESTJ's you are having problems with simply dont know they're acting this way? Especially if they are family wouldn't you like a good relationship with them? We are extroverts", aka not good at listening, we're not always good at noticing when we do something that may seem offensive or controlling, and no we're not really that gushy. But I will tell you that we are complete suckers for those in pain, especially if it is because of something we said or did. It simply crushes us. All I can say is, I am way more of a softer person because my mom and sister (ENFP and INFP) both had the guts to tell me that what i was doing was hurtful to them. I could actually go into great detail about how some INF's are passive aggressive and I would say that's equally as bad as yelling in a straight forward manner, but I can understand that that is who they are and although it might not be the best way to handle things in my opinion, it is part of who they are. If my ENFP mother taught me anything its to appreciate all the good things and deal with the bad things when they come. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Believe me", I know a lot about being that mean bully that you all can see. But I never knew I was doing that until my sister flat out told me.

I have a chow dog and if you've ever met one, they're in particularly similar an ESTJ. I've never had a more loyal dog.    we can generalise because the ESTJs i met are like that too, and see how many of them are! its not coz of 1 person, i can also agree with what he says here and we have known diferent ESTJs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	if it would be 1 or 2 ESTJ examples who came accross like that then fair enough we couldnt generalise", but if they are generally like that, then although Im sorry you have to hear that, it is their steriotype for a reason, see how many people arount the forum have similar opinions to that person?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He can come across as being a bit arrogant sometimes (or at least that's how others see him) and a bit of a know it all but when I pick him up on that or disagree with him on something he takes it pretty well. He has been a very supportive friend recently and is a good listener. He is very encouraging. He is often aware when he is telling someone what to do especially when we message each other for advice so he will say something at the beginning or the end to soften his direction", which is sweet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the time they just come across as cutting insults tho.    SAME with my sister.  I'm convinced she has to be ESTJ or borderline.

"ESTJ	When I was younger I absolutely despised ESTJ's. When you are younger and surrounded by them they can really get into ""mob mentality"" and the ones I knew would laugh at things that they didn't understand or sometimes even hear if they thought it would put someone that they thought was strange on the spot and make them look bad. My stepdad was an ESTJ and had a very ""my-way-or-the-highway"" approach to everything. Even when I would explain a more efficient alternative. I remember being a kid arguing with him for hours about things like why I should be allowed to sleep with my door closed", or why 10:30 was a more appropriate bedtime. Though, with age I have come to understand them, and my stepdad and I get along MUCH better now that I am a grown man. One of my closest friends for years is an ESTJ and while I do see him as somewhat of a conformist, he's a good guy at heart(same with my stepdad).

"ESTJ	Now I start to wonder..... Do all ESTJ have difficulties in prioritizing", deciding when to be strict or not?    Well here's my 2 cents I believe it has something to do with a small penis/penis envy. Cops feel insecure and need a gun to feel adequate.  No one become a cop to help people, and they don't do it for pay either - hence the gun.

I can assure you, I do not run around assaulting people - (1) it is an emotional response - we are not the feely, sensitive people, (2) likely to land you in jail - ESTJs love rules and think we should all abide in them and (3) overall, quite ineffective in getting the desired result.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do  think it has a lot to do with life experience.    Yeah i think the stereotypes change when you evolve into maturity. I think ESTJ's learn along the way that laws, meanings and ESTJ-like truths aren't the only thing that life is about, like any other personality learns that their personality is not the only truth. Maturity is the point where you can drop your stereotype and show what you can do to help the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A perfect example of Arthur Schopenhauer's quote: ""all truth passes through three stages: first it is ridiculed", second it is violently opposed," third it is accepted as self evident."" ...I don't really get what this is trying to say", am I the one who passes through three stages or is this what I'm supposed to think about others?    You're thinking a little too much about it and self-analyzing. It was meant to be thought-provoking. It is a proven fact that throughout history, whenever people have come up with new, innovative ideas, those who blindly and ardently cling to the status quo ridicule it because they aren't intelligent or open-minded enough to see that it may actually be plausible (true story, my ENFP beau as a Theoretical Physicist has this problem all the time. Many of the people he works with just aren't that educated in their field.) Then they vehemently deny its potential validity because it violates their pre-conceived notions," or because ""it's always been done this way""", but once the idea has reached a critical mass in the collective and they realize they are behind the times as it were, they begrudgingly accept the idea. Think about that for a while. A great example of that is the Catholic Church.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ			   How do you define ""incompetent""? Speaking from personal experience", my former district manager was a complete a-hole and nothing he ever did made any real difference in our workplace. He was my bete noire. Nobody liked when he came through the door because he was always super critical of every little thing. He wouldn't even let the cashiers have water to drink at their stations, for fear that someone would mess up our dinosaur computers (I shit thee not, 1985 software!), even though we technically weren't supposed to leave our area, which he really couldn't enforce because we usually ran a skeleton shift. He always made our lives difficult and seemed to have the nerve to think every one of us was incompetent. He continuously just made shit up to make himself feel important and to make sure we didn't get out of line. I hated following his arbitrary rules. Half the time we couldn't obey them even if we tried. I'm so glad I had an understanding store manager or else I would've been fired a long time ago, most likely for insubordination. He was such a jerk.   ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I am sure that there are some admirable ESTJs out there", I just have not met any yet...it seems the bad apples just ruin the whole barrel :(    Well, I think we should give the type as a whole the benefit of the doubt. They are one of the more common types and I'm sure we run in to some everyday who are likely very respectable. There are some who are judges, teachers, police officers, and they work within the rules and protect stability and structure in our society. If it were up to a bunch of NFs, I think we'd have all sorts of criminals running around b/c of our tendency to be merciful, sometimes unduly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He's very rigid & very controlling. He seems to see his parenthood as strictly a duty & nothing more, which annoys me, & he's pretty full of himself; as in, he doesn't listen to other people's point of view & he's very high-and-mighty & stuck in his own ways. He makes lame jokes & he's overall pretty boring. Always thinks he's right & always trying to convince people to share his views rather than seeing valid points in others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Still", I hate stereotypes. If I know another ESTJ, it's either not as obvious as my dad or I just am not paying attention. Overall I'm not interested in pushing stereotypes onto other people.

They are of a ""cause and effect"" nature. They are good people who worry a lot"," they are trying to lead perfect and good lives and they have been through a lot of shit at some point. Their sometimes black and white nature (not meaning to be offensive) is out of a need to create security and set boundaries. They need for things to be ""set"," and done a certain way. Me on the other hand, I'm more of a rule breaker, I drive these individuals nuts, because I'm often lost in my own mind and have always"" had to learn things the hard way and I don't like schedules", I feel bound by too many rules... I'm a nightowl and I get worried when things are too ordered and perfect. I expect the unexpected... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Not all stereotypes have to be negative", though. I'm an INFP and my husband is an ESTJ and some of the positive stereotypes are the things I value most about his contribution to our relationship: I never feel emotionally insecure with him because he is loyal, steady and dependable and always fulfills his promises and obligations. His emotional steadiness makes a nice bedrock foundation for me to anchor myself during flights of fancy or emotional stress. On the other hand, where he tends to be authoritative in the raising of our children, he often confers with me about discipline and drawing lines and nurturing them so that he can do right by them and not be a bully or overbearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An unhealthy ISFJ will probably be too clingy, dependant, and have a huge need to be needed, and selfish too. I'm just pointing this out.

She's 6 years old now and she is the most stubborn", charismatic, gutsy, rude, fun, troublesome and silly child I've ever known. She thinks she knows everything, she begins to teach you nonsensically and if I had to describe her in a few words they'd be. Presumptuous, manipulative, intelligent, and loving.

"ESTJ	***OP"," the only one I disagree with on your list is ""direct and truthful when communicating with others"". While they are often truthful and easy to read", their communication style can be indirect and they often imply things instead of stating them explicitly. For example, they may phrase a statement in the form of a question, and expect the listener to take it as a statement. The first instance that comes to mind is when my little brother eats with his fingers," my ESTJ father will say ""DO YOU HAVE A FORK!?"" instead of ""use your fork"". Bad example", but it is one of many.    I am having a first relationship with an ESTJ.  We have the hardest time communicting.  I try to read into what he is saying because in my experience his sentence says a whole lot of shit.  That I don'taddress because I don't want to go there.  I know I'mnot making sense. We have only been dating about 6 weeks.  Hopefully, more will be revealed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He just do all the administrative stuff all the time, writing nice report to obtain grants etc... He his like  a project manager but absolutely not a researcher. the odd thing is that being like this, he just ruined my career as a researcher. He is absolutely unable to understand that people could think or behave in another way. The funny thing is that he is german and I am jewish, and that he he had several antisemitic remarks. For me an ESTJ is just like a german officer. Nice guy socially, doing all what the system expect him to do, protecting his familiy, adopting sofisticated and very conformistic behavior in public. But if something doesn't  belongs to his system, he think it must be exterminated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let them be happy. They have beautiful hearts, they have GOLDEN hearts, the reason that they have such a bad reputation is because of the vulnerability that comes along with trusting people/ yourself, and this is why they are so out of touch with their hearts. I'll admit, I've had more than a few clashes with my ESTJ dad, but over time I've come to realize that he doesn't realize he is being selfish, so how can I blame him and get angry at him for not listening to me/placing himself above me. By letting him get to you, you have lowered yourself to his level, don't do this to yourself. Remember, as hard as it is to accept," it's nobody's ""fault""", there is a cause for everything.

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Happy   Tell me what ESTJ stereotypes you have heard of. This is in no way an attack on ESTJ's. This thread just gives awareness to the stereotypes of the ESTJ personality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Here is my list of ESTJ stereotypes..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1.) Does not question the law",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2.) Conservative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3.) Bullies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4.) Unprogressive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	5.) Paranoid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	6.) Bias towards their own beliefs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	7.) Critical of others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	8.) Strict",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	9.) Boring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others.    As with everything in life that is stereotyped", I can at least see where they originated. But of course, stereotyping is just a lazy person's way of 'understanding' the world! I do like this list of stereotypes, however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	A close friend of mine is an ESTJ", and an old teacher of mine also was. They definitely displayed some of these traits to a degree; these clearly displayed traits were being critical of others, and being direct and truthful (or, blunt). In terms of criticism of others, these two people will let people know if what they are doing is against the ESTJ's moral values, or against the values or emotions of someone the ESTJ held close, or if there was an element of injustice. In this way, the stereotype of 'bullying' in my eyes is perceivable, but perhaps incorrect; ESTJ's might seem like bullies when their rags are pulled, but will in fact be trying to support morality, happiness, and most of all, justice and fairness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The bluntness has always made me laugh; I like it when people are blunt with me. I believe ESTJ's feel the only way forwards into true progression (of course", this is how THEY personally perceive what progression is) is to tell people the truth. This means, if you've pleased them, you will know. If you have good traits you will know. Naturally, this also counts for the opposite. ESTJ's in my experience don't like dysfunction. For everything to be in working order, an ESTJ will identify the problem, and hope the person has the initiative to sort it out! If the targeted individual is actually suffering or struggling with something, this may come across as insensitivity and bullying- but I feel that the original aim was to improve standards for everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The more I read of this", the more I feel you're describing Bill O'Reilly! Hah, ahhh...that crazy bastard might not think he's far-Right, but the Tea Party are still handing him biscuits over the fence...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	But I digress. I feel ESTJ's do have a habit of being unswaying in their beliefs", but let's face it- everyone, of any type, race, religion, or creed, is ultimately unbending in some areas. Perhaps ESTJ's just tend to be a little more so. Is it bravery? Is it arrogance? Who knows! For those that I know, I accept it as part of their nature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Now the last part is...boring?! Ahahah...fuck man. You need to come over and have tea and biscuits with my ESTJ friend and I some time. At the end of the day", your massively increased knowledge of the Cold War, Communist Propaganda, Ancient Greece, Disney Movies and what type of biscuits to have next will PROVE that they're not boring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	- if you say", 'ok' and then do something your way  they will spend the whole week trying to comprehend why they did  not double check, but will finally come to some  awkward conclusions like: 'no one else know how to do stuff, apart from me!' or 'next time i'll do it myself to be sure it s done right'!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Ashleyshrugged   I'm sure there are plenty of people in this world that don't like me because of my personality type", but in my case I've found the key factor is weather people are F's or T's.  Every single one of my friends is a T.  My husband is an INTP," which actually works out incredibly well.  He sort of needs someone to ""do the things he doesn't like to do""", like planning and cleaning the house, and I really need to have someone who listens to me and gives me great advice, he is great at creating a big picture plan, and I'm good with the details.  Now F's on the other hand, I can barely understand you guys.  It really stinks because 75% of women are F's," so most of my friends are men.  I do have a few girlfriends but many of them just have a hard time with how I will basically tell it like it is and I'm not very concerned with their ""feelings"".  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I think that lots of F's take everything I say too personally", I'm generally not trying to offend them.  Think of Dr. Tempe Brennan on Bones, she just says things that are true sometimes even if others find them insensitive, I can't even understand why people would be offended by my pointing out the truth about something...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Ok this was a really long post so If you made it to hear", bravo, and if not, O well :).    How sure are you that you are an S?  Also, how sure are you that you are a T?  I am a good people reader and I suspect that you are neither... ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	A few things stood out to me as being atypical of an ESTJ.  First of all", you're too abstract for an S.  It seems to me your thinking on these issues and relationships are anything but grounded and concise.  Your tangents on yelling and the dilemma on whether or not to give aid to Africa are two examples of inductive logic--expounding on a smaller example into the larger issues involved.  Inductive logic is often preferred by Idealist/NF's, as is your focus on relationships and people.  Guardians (SJ's) prefer linear ways of thinking which would avoid taking on such tangential topics.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Moreover", Guardians don't often understand and get along well with NT Rationals (e.g. your husband), and, though of course two mature individuals of any temperament make a successful marriage work, SJ/NT marriages tend to be fraught with misunderstandings and an inability to relate to one another which makes mutual satisfaction difficult to achieve.  If you are finding things work out splendidly with your NT husband, and without much effort, then I question your personality test results. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	David Keirsey (also an INTP", btw, like your husband) studied the Myers Briggs and found several weaknesses.  In particular, he found that Myers-Briggs test is not very accurate in terms of measuring N vs. S.  I would recommend that you take the Keirsey temperament sorter and see if you get the same results as your MB test.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Moreover", I would add that NF Idealists (I am one myself) are more prone than any other temperament to get false results on personality sorters.  Besides the flaws of the test, we are too good at understanding what the question is getting at, and too self-effacing to understand ourselves in terms of absolutes.  I took MB three times and never got an accurate result.  The first result said I was ISFP, the second ESFJ, and the third was also a Guardian.  But I am an ENFP, no doubt about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I believe you regarding the E and J", so I would likely peg you as ENFJ.  It's funny that you think of the world in terms of T's and F's and I think you are an F yourself.  But perhaps the T/F difference that you are referring to is actually the N/S dichotomy. According to Keirsey, about 80% of the population is S, consistent with your breakdown of 75% of women being hard for you to understand.  Keirsey pins the N/S dichotomy as the most important one for temperaments--the one that breaks the world down into groups of people you understand vs. groups of people you don't understand.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	N's are the abstract folk--the one's who can take an idea and get so fully absorbed in it that they can lose awareness of their surroundings.

"ESTJ	Keirsey's book Please Understand Me II is wonderful", much more clear and compelling than his website, although the website is also good.  He helps clarify many of the misunderstandings caused by Myers-Briggs mistakes and clear up much the confusion as to who we are and why we do what we do. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	BTW", if you are an ENFJ married to an INTP, you would be in what Keirsey found empirically was the best sort of compatibility within marriage--same with regards to N/S, complementary in every other respect.  He found these sorts of marriages--Idealists/Rationalists and Guardian/Artisan--were more successful than any other matches. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Yep. You guessed it. Your type is THAT one. And", let me fuck your shit up something fierce. An INTP would rather die than obey you unconditionally. Humans are not psychic. INTPs are, by nature, the first to question everything and anything. So, when your obvious God Complex triggers and you expect all humans to psychically know how you expect a problem to be solved, exactly, and when you expect all humans who don't GET YOU to capitulate, us worthless piece of shit INTPs who flip you the bird and carry on as we do are so fucking frustrating to you types.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Accuse me of type bigotry all you'd like. But all other unhealthy MBTI types", when they act like total shitheads, the CAUSE is them being unhealthy, and the EFFECT is dependent on their type. With  ESTJs, though, I really think the cause is being an ESTJ," and the effect is becoming unhealthy because some important people don't unconditionally capitulate to you. I am more than willing to take infraction points or a temp ban for saying this. I have NEVER met an ESTJ who I'd consider ""healthy"," and doubt I ever will.

When we are with her, her meals are always on time, and delicious, wholesome, great salad dressing (who has time to make salad dressing anymore??). So her jokes are shallow--I have learned more from her about how to take care of my family and myself than I have ever learned from any NT intellectual's discourse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Most ESTJs would not be on this forum because they are too engaged in the world around them; too engaged with their duties", chorelists, responsibilities, etc. A lot of the stereotypes people are making here are half-true--yes, they are unyielding--but no, that doesn't make them all assholes. There are several situations in life in which being unyielding is a very good thing--i.e. giving someone who needs it a good kick in the pants. Many N's (who dominate these boards) would not appreciate said kick-in-the-pants, but a lot of folks--SP's especially, who account for up to 40% of the population--love it when someone cares enough about them to deliver it with force. Another thing SJs tend to be great at is making life run smoothly, on time, making sure there is milk in the refrigerator, etc. Without SJs, we would all surely perish, our society would malfunction like a printer machine just when you need it, us lost and languishing in our own distracted creativity. Like other good folks have pointed out, the goodness or badness of a person--their level of maturity--has NOTHING to do with temperament. There are good and bad versions of ANY temperament. While temperament friction certainly exists, maturity is what allows us to see beyond these stereotypes, into the reality of the person across from us.  Close up, we are the same, doing the best we can with what we have been given. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	It can be thinking-heavy", objective, and all that. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	So from cognitive functions theory I'm going to say the idea of ESTJ ~ traditional and all that is crazy", and that they can fit a lot of what is often associated to INTJ.

I think most ESTJ stereotypes stem from the fact that people often mistype people they dislike as ESTJs. It is very difficult to type most people", because you only see a certain part of them.

"ESTJ	Here is my list of ESTJ stereotypes..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1.) Does not question the law",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2.) Conservative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3.) Bullies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	8.) Strict",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	9.) Boring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	10.) Direct and truthful when communicating with others.    Sums it up nicely. :-P Really though", each person will have deviations from this, so it is not absolute. Heck, most of my test end in a near 50/50 P/J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Was reading through this thread due to my curiosity of ESTJs. I haven't encountered one in person yet", or at least not to my knowledge...I don't typically like typing people I know. However, would any of the ESTJs on here know if it is common for other ESTJs not to be interested in mbti? From what I've read on this website and others, I get the feeling that some of them wouldn't see the point in taking the test, or spending a significant amount of time on it. Is that why I haven't come across another ESTJ yet (that I know of)? Do you guys find that it comes up in conversations a lot with people you know, or would you rather talk about more imporant topics? Just curious :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I'm an INFP and I frankly couldn't care less if ESTJs pretend to not like me because I realize that they don't even understand themselves that they really do. I make them laugh unexpectedly", I amuse them, and I entertain them. As much as they want to believe that the INFP is everything against what they stand for, they need to just come right out and tell us that they actually love everything about us and didn't think they could ever feel this way about anyone. If the puzzle fits...stop being ridiculously cold, cruel, and logical and admit that you're attracted to people nothing like yourself and you can both be real about it because that's the level you connect on anyway. The level of getting REAL about life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I don't get the negative stereotypes here- sure", they're demanding and bossy, but they get the job done. Yeah, they're blunt, but isn't that good?

I know he's a good guy inside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Yes", he is quick to get angry, but he blows off quick, too. Once he told me that he had problems being perceived as aggressive and too serious, and said he wanted to be fun and easy-going like my other friends. He liked the control, sure, but this proves (well in my case) that ESTJ's aren't all about power and commanding respect. They wanna have fun too, but they're also serious when they need to be. We talked around and it was clear that he had principles, and that's very admirable. He reached the conclusion that he won't change just because other people wanted him to or because he wanted to be perceived differently. He knows what he is, and he'll stay true to himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I've observed that a lot of the negative stereotypes came from many F's and that's understandable.

"ESTJ	ESTJ here. This is actually my first post on P-Cafe. I've realized that we are extremely underrepresented on MBTI discussions and it has led me to join. It's a shame to see so many almost exclusively negative stereotypes on here about the ESTJ. We're not all a bunch of hardened", inconsiderate authoritative doms who lack emotion. I never raise my voice and have never been violent. I consider myself a doer and a dreamer (although probably more of a doer) and although I/we can be very career-oriented, I/we frequently go out of my way to try to help others. I am a professional musician - very unexpected of ESTJ stereotypes - and I devote my life to artistic and interpersonal pursuits. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I'm betting on the latter in this case.    If i believed the stereotypes", I wouldnt be asking him to explain it to me. I wouldnt have asked in the first place. Accepting at face value does not really explain to a person why its right or wrong. In fact its not wise to accept things face value. I never fully accept things face value and I always question or look for information. I could be wrong in understanding, or my experience could give me the wrong conclusion because I fully do not know the person or type. Its a fault in our types as INFPs, taking things at face value. Sometimes its good and okay but it is not the wisest approach. Why? because then you will not be able to explain in a logical and rational way why its not acceptable to others so they can understand and either agree or disagree. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	That can be read two ways in fact. It depends on the tone of the person too and its why online words do not translate well in terms to others. Im asking with sincere aspect of understanding because i see all this stuff about ESTJs and it contradicts and it feels wrong too. I want the truth and closure so I am asking from the source. I can understand if you feel protective of them but I do mean no harm. You shouldnt be so judgmental of people like that. Its not understanding English because again you assume I know what you mean and what you are talking about.  What does it mean to be good at English in your eyes? Because people have different takes on it. Like I do not even know what ESL means. As an INFP", i think I would not question what I believe in correct? I believe in children and consistency, especially with honor and words. I do not feel a need to question this. Yet here I am questioning these stereotypes that pop in my mind when I hear ESTJ and when I read people's words and on google. Its annoying. SO," I am asking for answers. I can understand how that sentence can mean ""Well i think it is so you should prove to me how it is not."" But I did not mean it that way to which I apologize. If you do not believe me or want to say I am this and that so be it. But I know what I am asking and I really should not have to explain that except to an ESTJ (since the question is directed at them).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Pinina   If you want an answer from me as well", I will give you one when I can. I'm at my phone and it's late, but I'll explain.    Okay, thanks! :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Tsubaki   First of all", you came here, without at least reading up the functions and just wanted us to disprove some judgemental misconceptions? In which world is that appropriate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Imagine if I went to the INFP forum and said: ""As far as I heard", you're all sociophobes who lock themselves up in their room. Also, you self-harm and create your own fantasy world in your imagination. Please prove me wrong, otherwise," I won't believe you!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It's really impolite", you know? I consider it fine for now, but please at least read up on a type, before you make such posts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Now for this post: I mostly have this problem", when I need to depend on another person, who doesn't do what he was supposed to. Sometimes, I need the help of others and if they aren't doing anything and are just standing in the way, I tend to get very impatient.    To answer the first one, I find it okay. Because im actually coming here to see and disprove it. I mean all I see and hear is how they are this and that and like I said I dont like to take things face value. Google gave a gist of how you are but it doesnt explain function fully and how you see the world, behave and think. I want to know that and I love learning and reading on it. I mean I used to think SJs would be a hazard to me based on the general descriptions from mbti. But really its all in the functions like Isabel said. And I mean I had bad run ins with ESTJs before excluding one. I often felt they werent patient enough with me but again it could just be me and my OCD. So I wanted to disprove it on here due to no help from any other source. or the other sources were and are unreliable. I also wish to understand how that is unacceptable towards you too. So I dont repeat it and keep it in mind when I reflect and stuff. I mean I knew you had Te and Si but I didnt know of the other functions. Like you said about seeing the world differently, I function differently. I ask vague questions and its hard for me to specify it without first thinking of the question for a bit. I mean I dont hate you guys im just getting sick of the air people are breathing out and want to find the pure one. By you disproving the judgmental conceptions, I am able to learn what is really true of you than forced to rely on what others say. Who better to know than an ESTJ themselves?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Artemis 2x4   Hmmm okay. So like relying on someone who is unreliable right?    That's basically it", yes. Sometimes, I'm forced to work with someone else and can't just do everything by myself. If we have to be finished at a certain time," I really have no understanding for: ""Wait"," let me just check XY first"""," ""We don't need it"," but I'm going to make a diagram for this"""," ""don't be so stressed"," we won't finish that anyway""", or the INTP who spent half an hour folding an origami unicorn.

"ESTJ	Hmmm i understand you just want to finish the task at hand. What if someone wishes to double check so its done correctly? Like in nursing school we are taught that sometimes and often its important to double check what you check off write", calculations etc for the patient. And i mean like reading those, to me its like a fail-safe in case what we do does not work or is enough ya know? Cuz stuff does not always go as planned. And I mean being stressed over something like that yes, I can definitely understand why you are upset. But also a part of me is saying, perhaps you couldnt have finished in time or they forsaw it because of the external things that played into the situation and you did not? These are possibilities that pop in my head when I read things people say. Like theres often a reason for it even if you dont see or understand it and its okay to ask questions and etc.  Lol the unicorn.......maybe he was doing it to relax? Or something. Art can be releasing to a person and origami does take a while to do. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Overall I getcha and understand and I agree to a certain point. But because im me and function differently id say to sometimes consider maybe its not what you think? And ask about it. Like the origami thing. Id be interested to know why he was doing it and if its wasting time especially. If im making you upset or anything by this tell me I dont want to hinder on your thoughts and feelings this is jsut my take and perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Welcome to the forum. The amount of times I've said we ESTJs aren't all like that is reaching about hundred", so I'm not going to bother with it anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by rybread   i'm fully aware that i may just be dealing with an unhealthy ESTJ", but isn't it curious that the majority of us on this thread have had similar experiences?    Well it's either one of two possibilities:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	A) ESTJs have a higher proportion of unhealthy people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	B) There are certain traits that people believe are ESTJ exclusive", so people assume anyone who possesses those traits is ESTJ, even if they aren't Te dominant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Honestly the guy you described sounds like an unhealthy ExFJ if anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	that makes sense. the major give away for me was that she always says"," ""i'm just following orders"". as an intp that is constantly searching for new and better ways to do things", it just bothers me a little. would her saying that be more estj or esfj?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd say neither. I can't see myself ""just following orders""", and I can't theorize a reason why ESFJs would either. I think it's just something some people do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sounds like she just wanted to avoid the aggro by deflecting responsibility. Not indicative of type.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	And besides", Te Dom don't follow no rules, we make them. :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strong Te is anything but ""just following orders"". It's more common for weak Te to be this way", because it lacks sophistication and person can't use it creatively, inventing and establishing new methods and ways of doing things, doesn't excel at understanding when and how to apply logic of external activity or how to manipulate any given situation to this end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	For example", this is excerpt from the description of weak Te.    This person easily believes in facts and figures, often turn a deaf ear to everything but these. Keeps to places where he knows what to do in every situation. Suggestible by the external order of things, which is often the order that was in place during his upbringing: the political system, social norms, etc. Always moves in the direction of highest order and carefully avoids chaos, is inspired by this order and worries that in future it might change. Knowledge of the facts of the situation often replaces true understanding of the underlying problems. Understanding becomes superficial, simply a collection of surface data and statistics, laws and regulations. He does not like long and detailed explanations," will immediately interrupt and say: ""So what is this in actuality?"". He wants to get a working solution or order right away", not the rationale behind it. Likes terminology, you can sometimes talk to him only using some accepted terms and this will be sufficient. Especially gets influenced by the facts that he sees with his own eyes or can touch with own hands. Thus he can fall victim to scams that provide specious claims and facts," especially if the scam is done out in the open (""simple dexterity of hands and no tricks"").",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	The thing is", the ESTJ type is not homogeneous, some fit the stereotype and others like myself are more centred. In fact sometimes I wonder how I am able to tap into my Fe with others when Myers-Briggs say I should have an inferior Fi. Maybe Socionics is more accurate!

Behaviors that I would enjoy and laugh about in a private setting become my worst nightmare when happening in public. Like using derogatory language (insensitive towards race, LGBT, you name it) blatantly in front of those very people who may be sensitive to it, as if those people in the room are non existent. Its relentless towards the possibility that those very people live under difficult circumstances. Yet... ESTJ's dont give a flying f*** about people who appear to have no utility or close relationship with them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	2) do you endorse speech laws?    1) Guardian tends to work for me but that's way more an 8 thing than an ESTJ thing in my opinion. Not much about my functions makes me a guardian the way I'd consider the word... I think they meant 'guardian of traditions/mores/whatever' which couldn't be much further from the truth. My values", traditions, holiday ideals, etc are INCREDIBLY personal and yes, I prefer to maintain them in the way that means the most to me, which is rarely the way my extended family likes it (tonnes of 40+ year old SJ's up in there fucking up my fun). I think 'Executor' would be more appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	'Supervisor'.... eh. This only happens when I'm stuck doing group work and I know for a fact the other people are fucking morons. I've been known my whole life for 'carrying' my teams but it's not because I am a control freak", almost the opposite. I just hate telling people what to do. If somebody doesn't pony up, I'll do it my damn self.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2) To put it plainly", I agree with freedom of speech laws but nobody is entitled to think that it protects them from retaliation when they act like a c***. Talk shit, get hit. If you're scared to put your name on it, maybe there's a good fucking reason for that. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Hate speech laws in my country cover what is necessary and I believe they'll remain necessary for some time. Again", if you want to spout off some homophobic racist bullshit, just do it in your own back yard. Freedom of speech also doesn't mean anybody has to listen to you. At all. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	For example", my super conservative bible thumping Grandmother (ESTJ too jfc) remains convinced it's a violation of Freedom of Speech for us to ban Westboro Baptist Church from entering Canada. No. No it's not. They break hate speech laws constantly, have incredibly disruptive public behaviour, etc. They're entitled to say whatever the heck they want, and they do that in the US and other countries, and online and so on. They're not entitled to think they can bring that garbage up here, or that there wouldn't be consequences for their actions. Other countries with similar hate speech laws have also barred them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I think that the monetary worth of someone would be their current capital added with a scalar multiplied by their potential capital in the future. However", a person's worth to me is completely subjective, and thus a general consensus would be difficult to achieve. I personally think that people are invaluable in a personal sense, replaceable in an industrial sense, and in comparison to others, equal. I sometimes have difficulty empathizing with those who have lost a loved one, because 1) ESTJs just aren't very empathetic, and 2) Many people die every day. It's a fact of life. Move on, even if it's hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I consider a great act of kindness to be one in which the one who acted served another without an expectation or recognition", praise, thanks, or something in return. Secondly, but perhaps more significantly, spending time with someone. We all have a truly very limited time here on Earth, and when someone is willing to spend a lot of it with you, even in your down times, then that person has shown you great kindness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Does that count as a rule? It was kinda three...    Instill traditional family values (family above others", honesty, respect, give your best effort & be forgiving) & lay the foundation for good character by instilling basic morals (don't lie, cheat, steal or harm) during a child's formative years. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	School is no place for children to learn the basics", but rather a place that will test & attempt to corrupt a child's character.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Spare the rod", but not to the extent of spoiling the child. I believe in gentle spanking for unacceptable behavior, but following up by discussing improvement toward expected behavior is critical to encouraging growth in the right direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Think think think before you act", choose friends carefully & walk away from trouble whenever you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Dumaresq   How do you judge the worth of people?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	What do you consider a great act of kindness?    I believe that everyone has the same worth", but again I'm a subjective human being, and therefore value people different. So rather than saying that I judge the worth of people, I'd say I judge their worth to me, and what they can contribute with to me and to the society. If they don't do what they're assigned on time, that would decrease this. If they hinder the progression of things by being plain stupid, things like that. But still, it doesn't decrease their actual worth or value, just how I view them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Something I'd consider a great act of kindness would be something you do for another person for the reason of helping them in some way", and not expecting something in return, even in form of recognition for what they've done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by haephestia   It manifests a lot more in ESJs than I think other types (mostly NTs) would ever care to admit. We're able to apply a lot of weird situational information to get the job done. While the stereotype is that if an ESTJ walks into a room at work and the supply closet is all changed around", we lose our shit and start sobbing in the corner, that's so wrong it's hilarious. I walk into the room," go 'wtf why..."" and Ne takes over"," gearing up with Te to say ""well it must be because of this... or because this is a better arrangement... well this looks like the supply room on the 3rd floor now!"" and Ta-daa dissonance solved.

I'm an avid runner and exercise every day, and I run a pretty popular fitness blog that takes up a fair bit of my spare time sometimes.

"ESTJ	4. I'd like to be involved in Phase 1 (making the idea) and in control of Phase 2. I like helping conceive plans", but I especially love bringing them into reality.

I guess I attribute it partially to being an 8 but I don't think I have that big of an outward emotional range. I've got that kind of stuff pretty much on lock... I've cried over patients I've had before but never in front of anyone. When my jimmies do get rustled for whatever reason I'm always able to decipher why pretty quickly.

"ESTJ			   Hell yes I do. I used to be a voracious reader", I'd go through a novel or two a week year round when I was in grade school right through to my second or third year of college. Now that I'm finishing my 7th consecutive year of post-secondary ed (lol kill me please) and am in a really heavy program, I don't get to read as much as I used to. But I read on the treadmill and listen to audiobooks when I get the chance, so that helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Now I read a lot more dystopian future/alternate reality stuff", more 'realistic fantasy' I guess. The market's pretty much flooded with it at the moment and one of my novels is a dystopian fantasy. Otherwise I just finished reading Graceling and it's prequel and really enjoyed them, but I think even more than fantasy/AU I'm more and more hooked on historical fiction.

"ESTJ	I'd be more pissed with my husband because he works in the medical field and I'll be a registered nurse in a year.

"ESTJ	Distractions in life have always been around", but technology and modern society have made it easier than ever before to portray impossibly perfect personas (think: Photoshop + makeup + plastic surgery + etc), and nurture obsessive behaviour like this.

"ESTJ	1. Are there common situations that ESTJs excel or struggle with? For  example", high school is generally not a fun time for INFPs.Excel with: I don't have much problem at school, always among Top 10 in class, always chosen as class administrator, joined lots of clubs, had decent friends. I was a responsible child, my parents trusted me more than my older brother. I took care of household when they were at work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Struggle: Because I'm a responsible person and never complain", my friends, siblings, teachers, and parents dropped most of the heavy burden and responsibility on my shoulder. They didn't care about my feelings because they think I can handle everything. But actually I was very upset because I feel used, exploited, and abandoned. Maybe that is why I have a lot of anger.

Just because I don't cry, doesn't mean I'm not sad. Just because I act cruel, doesn't mean I cannot empathize. Just because I don't show it, doesn't mean I don't have feelings. I do feel, but I have priorities other than following my emotional drive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	2. Do you find common interests among ESTJs on this site? Is that just a coincidence? ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3. Easiest way to commit a faux pas to an ESTJ in conversation or action? Easiest way to show understanding?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4. When you aren't in here", what other sub-forums do you frequent?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	One point of nuance: I'm not asking to form stereotypes", and I apologize if I come off that way.    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I liked the video", personally! One of the better descriptions of our type I've ever seen. Like many of us I'm sure have said, we're much like ENTJs except that instead of percolating theory, we're much more concerned with making things happen tangibly, in the real world. Thus the much fewer number of ESJs, particularly ESTJs, on the forum. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	1. I'd agree with ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	@WickedQueen  ", I excelled in school and still do. Academic settings suit me for the most part, although I have to say now that I've been interacting directly with patients for so long, I don't think I could go back to a straight-up 'objective' job in health care. I did have many decent friends and still do, and while it's harder for me to make close friends now, I suspect that is more enneagram subtype than MBTI. I am perfectly capable of getting along with and working alongside most people in terms of MTBI leanings. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I struggle when it comes to 'empathizing with fools'", as well as 'social patience', according to my husband. He counts it as a struggle that I am 'not entertained by people acting stupidly' and that 'when people would see someone skateboarding down the street carrying a second person other people would look at it and be like 'wow hahahaha that's so silly' and you'd be like 'those fucking idiots'. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	....... I guess that's a problem? Who fucking knew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	2. Same", sometimes I have things in common, other times now. Most of the time I find the themes of my interests the same as ESTJs around my own age, and the younger or much older ones to be completely incomprehensible (or at least very visibly immature),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	3. Be inconsistent or brush me off are the more minor ones. They're the ones that will make me think you are an idiot and nullify any opinion beyond 'neutral' I had of a person. Acting as though I am incompetent without assessing my abilities or treating me as incompetent in general will make me envision ways to make your life a living fucking hell from now until you're nothing to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	4. I tend to look at the enneagram forums a lot", as I enjoy that theory of PT. I like the polls and health and fitness as well. Otherwise, I'm just here there and everywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Please watch and post your thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Mingzhu   Okay", this has been bugging me for some time. What is ESTJ approach to PDA? If there is any general approach (I know it depends on the partner and relationship and that every ESTJ is different...etc). You can keep it scientific or talk about your personal approach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Thanks ^.^    Are you referring to holding hands while walking", or maybe hugging & kissing while picnicking in a park? Maybe piggyback rides & horsing around at the beach?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ESTJs are just as open", affectionate & loving as other human beings.  Forget the stereotypes of robotic personality, the mean step parent that ruined juniors childhood & the prick supervisor that makes you work on Saturdays. Those are likely unhealthy examples of every type rather than those ESTj & ENTJ meanies LOL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Seriously though", ESTJs are much harder on themselves than anybody else in their life & I highly doubt the accuracy of those poor abused souls that assume their nemesis is an ESTJ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETP males under 30 make me seriously debate whether it'd be worth going to prison for murder if it meant getting them to finally shut up. Again, not an issue for the ones I know over 30, they're pretty bomb. ETP young women don't tend to bother me either. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Fe only 'bothers' me in that I find it comes off quite disingenuously in conversation. I have several close friends who are Fe doms and once you get past that veneer", it's all good. Fi dom/aux doesn't bother me but again, over 22 or bust. Under that they can be pretty intolerable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	So", as people with Ni PoLR, I was wondering if you have a strong distaste for sarcasm? Sarcasm being when someone says something but actually means something completely different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I want to post some examples of people who have used sarcasm to get famous", and I want to know your impressions: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	^Sarah uses it off and on. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	^Aubrey uses it for nearly everything she says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I fucking love sarcastic humour", to a point. I think if you're trying to actually accomplish something through a point as a positive... let me rephrase. If you are trying to make a positive point in an argument or a positive point against a negative with humour, doing it with sarcasm is going to fall flat. Sarah Silverman is a great example. I fucking love her as an actress, she has got the straight-up take no shit style that I adore, but excess sarcasm to try and make a point is just irritating. There are better ways to do it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Not that he's a great example", but my husband is an Se-Ni user, an ESFP. My best friend of 15 years, 5 years longer than I've known my husband, is an INTJ. I get along with ENFJs to a certain degree and do alright-ish with INFJs. ENTJs tend to get on my nerves but that's because the ones I know are young men. Any male under 20 and ENTX gets on my nerves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I don't really get the POLR thing. I haven't studied socionics to any degree", but I get along with people who use Ni just fine as long as they're not off into completely ridiculous social theory to explain why they have no friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Because I develop a system and I stick to it. I do my dishes every morning when I get up before I make breakfast", I clean my kitchen and bathroom every Sunday. Ergo, my apartment isn't a general stye like most of my friends'. I can write essays fast because I've written over 1000 at this point; my system is really good and efficient. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	My room sometimes looks like a bomb detonated there", but I still know, where eyerything is most of the time. However, when it comes to homework, tests and exams, I absolutely hate not knowing when I have to finish something or what I have to learn. One of the most frustrating things for me is, when I missed class and nobody is able to tell me what I have to do for homework. I have a book diary which I use to keep track of almost everything I have to do and when I have to finish it. Usually, I just do the smaller tasks on the day before they are due and everything bigger about three days earlier. I usually seperate bigger projects into small parts and set my own time, when I want to have each of them finished. Sometimes, especially on weekends, I lose track of what I have to do, so I start making detailed lists ^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I'm wondering if I can be one of you guys and Te seems like a good fit", but its extraverted nature in dominant position puts me off a bit.    I'm not extraverted by 'layman's terms' and I can't say I've met an ESTJ who is. I can very much appear extraverted when I'm at work- you have to communicate to succeed at your tasks and be effective, and the joking around and helping people is just good for morale and building relationships with people! I enjoy working with others over working alone most of the time... like I'd rather work on a solitary task in the presence of others than work on it totally isolated, but there are exceptions too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I get burnt out spending too much time with people. I'm not much of one for initiating hanging out with others", but if I'm invited to something I'll usually go and have a great time. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	My social life tends to be pretty segregated too", like I've got friends I hang out with in groups because it's fun and we can party, then I have the friends I hang out with one on one or maybe 3 of us (who are usually my closer friends), there's acquaintances... People I know through organizations I'm a member or volunteer with that I only see there, classmates (99% of them I don't hang out with outside of school) and workmates (same deal). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Among the people I wouldn't hang out with outside of where we met", I can apparently appear pretty reserved and uninterested in forming stronger relationships... it's not intentional, but it pretty much is how I feel so I guess that works out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Regardless", don't let the E in Te put you off. The dominant function being externally focused has no bearing on your social orientation in function theory. They are related for plenty of people, but it's not a rule they be the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I'm wondering if I can be one of you guys and Te seems like a good fit", but its extraverted nature in dominant position puts me off a bit.    I do prefer to be with people, as much as possible, but I'm not that outgoing. Especially with strangers, I'm not talkative at all, and I can never think of anything to talk about, but I do get energized among other people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	As haephestia said", don't let the E take you away. Being an E is all about which is your dominant function.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	If I'm having a bad day", I usually want one of two things. Either I want to talk about it, even though sometimes it takes some lingering to make me talk about what troubles me. If that's not the case, I want to do something I enjoy with people I enjoy. It's often hard to tell which though (I think). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by kirkland   How do you console an ESTJ having a bad day?    When I'm having a bad day", I try not to show it too much. I keep smiling and being happy as usual, however I'm extremely vulnerable to stupidity and unproductivity. I usually try to keep my cool, but if someone asks the same questions all over again or doesn't do, what he was supposed to, I react pretty angry and sometime even yell at people, if they don't notice, how important what they are doing (or in this case not doing) is for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	That also happens sometimes", when I'm really stressed and someone is exhausting my nerves. There are a lot of warn signals, but some people just seem to ignore them.

I don't depend a lot on others and there is no social group, where I could get left out(I AM the group :P), because of it, so I just tell them, what my problem is ^^ (Sometimes, I'm over-simplifying things with this, but I usually(sometimes) find the moments, when it's necessary to be empathic and considerate)    I would say a child when they reach puberty and a teen when they reach 20. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Oh really? Hmmmm so you wouldnt mind If I said that whatever you said before bothered me and I expressed it then? I mean i do want to get along with you guys honestly so i want to know what to avoid and what to not avoid. I mean i follow with Fi and so everything I do must coincide with how I feel. Hmmm when you do feel responsible for them do you explain why its important that they know instead of like getting mad at them or judging them? Cuz INTJs do this like tell me what im doing wrong or this is wrong then dont elaborate on it so I get super mad about it. -___- I had to go to my ENFJ professor for explanation. I find I dont really have a lot of ESTJ or SJ friends actually. It might jsut be me", and thats fine too if our paths run in different directions and such but im odd and weird and I dont really follow the rule or norms. I think out loud, i talk to myself, im oblivious to when others hint things due to my ADHD and all but Im just not good with socializing either. I am compassionate and care about alot of people and to an extent what they think and thats just me. I may not agree with how others live and such and what they think as I will probably disagree but all in all, everyone has a purpose and path and I mean no one should say you are this and that when they themselves do not know. with any type its important to be open minded. And it really does all depend on the person. Like my mom and I had a discussion about me. She said in this world there are people who are the drones and just do what they are told or need to do without like consulting or really looking into it. And its needed its necessary but its not me and its not good for me. So what works for you wont work for me and vice versa. I just want you to trust me in what I say and not take it the wrong way since others on here have been..........closed minded. My advice is just advice and its just me being helpful and nice because well i care to a fault XP. So you can be open and trust me on that :3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Artemis 2x4   Okay i have a mind full of stereotypes here and I want to nullify them. Are you guys nice or kind? Patient and sincere? Cuz recently i had been around an ESTJ in my group and she was okay and such but I felt leeched by her in emotion and giving care like just caring because she did not return the affection. I just want to understand you guys more and the only ESTJs i know are not healthy ones :/ So do any of you care about others? Are open minded and willing to be patient as well? What do you think of NFs? INFP", INFJ, ENFJ, ENFP you know. What bothers you, what are you okay with? I have high standards for people who are around me and i talk with so it may be me as well but I just want to know if any of you are willing to come out of your comfort zone and such? O.o    I can't speak for all ESTJs. I can be nice and kind, but only when I'm not bothered by something. I try to be as patient and understanding as possible for me. Sincere, not all the time. But when I am, you feel it. At least that's what it seems like when I see people react to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Miyu   How can you tell the difference between ESTJs and ISTJs?    Ask yourself which one is more likely to run you over if you stand in their way. That's the ESTJ. ISTJs are much more cautious and self-doubting", and tend to far more passive. Three of my best friends are ISTJs- they're extremely organized, but they aren't much good at organizing other people. ESTJs motivate groups and organize projects, while ISTJs motivate themselves and organize themselves. As they grow older, many ISTJs do learn how to work with groups, but their natural preference is only a few people, while ESTJs like a much larger group to work with, and will often take a leadership role. I'm an ENTJ, and the ESTJs I know appear far more extraverted than I am. Last week my ESTJ friend and I went shopping, and she brought four of our other friends with us when I thought it would just be the two of us. ISTJs are far more likely to just go with the flow and follow along unless something is really wrong. They conserve their energy more.      Originally Posted by Whitewolf   Hi everyone!

"ESTJ	@TopCatLSD ", if he wants ^^    Man, I was a fuckin idiot when I was a kid. My parents used too worry about my health a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I was a baby still sleeping in the crib", my parents had given me my own room and put me right next to the window. Apparently I used to climb out of the crib and onto the window sill and stare outside, my parents found me dangling my feet out the window trying to escape (<thanks mom & dad) I did it so often that they eventually gave my room to my sis and made me sleep in their room so they could supervise me. When I was little I also had a habit of hiding in my house until my parents would cry cause they thought they lost me," then I'd burst out like ""SURPRISE BITCH!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I started going to school", I was constantly one of the most obnoxious kids in the class room. I was constantly making noise and trying to make my classmates laugh. My teachers hated me. Looking back I was probably a huge disappointment to me ESFJ dad, he always wanted us to be the most successful out of everyone in our peer group, but I would fail every academic subject and couldn't for my life concentrate in the classroom. I was also really possessive of girls I had crushes on (I think I still am, actually) if I saw any guy talking to them," I'd jump in and be like ""Uh"," no bitch! She's mine.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	My 12 year old life was probably the darkest point in my life. I was part of an underground fight club with me and my main group of friends. I was cool with the skater table", the black table, and the beaner table <well, the NOT as ghetto beaner table. (I'm hispanic, I can say that). We used to get like thirty people at a time to show up and watch our fights," it was so much fun. We used to plan fights like a day ahead of time and text out witch bathroom or hallway we where going to host it in. My job was to ""charm"" the campus supervisors into letting us go into the most empty parts of school"," I'd say ""We need to go to Mr.Whatshisfaces room"," we'll be quick"" or my favorite ""Oh campus supervisor #2 I almost didn't notice you got your hair done"," it looks nice!"" Cause there was so many of us", we had to brake into squads and use different paths to get their, my squad always had the easiest getting in. We also had a Youtube channel where we would post the fights, but it got taken down by the cops...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	After that was over I got to go home to my bipolar INFP mum whom I was living with; I'll spare the details. My parents where going through divorce", so all she could afford was a broken down piece of shit house with cockroaches and a falling roof. She would come home every night sobbing her eyes out, depressed. It was my responsibility to care for her emotionally. It felt like I was parenting her, and not the other way around.

Say why I had to eat with both fork and knife, if I don't use the knife, why would I have to have it in my hand? Why do I have to take of my shoes when it's dry outside and they aren't dirty? Why can't I go outside with just socks if they don't get dirty? I wanted answers on all of those questions, and I wanted the answers to make sense," so it really frustrated me when I got the answer ""that's how you do it"" or answers similar to that. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Another problem that arose is rather connected to inferior Fi than Te", but still. The general thing is that I wasn't always considerate to how other people would perceive what I was saying, so they got hurt. Best example I can think of is ones when my sister had a new cap, and well, I didn't think it fit her. So I told her so. She took it badly, and yea. My mom tried to explain to me that I shouldn't do stuff like that, but I just told her what I thought as a matter of fact. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I didn't really have any problem in school", until I was about 11/12. Before that I enjoyed it, I was good at what we did, I learnt stuff (I've always wanted to learn interesting things, though I have a hard time putting down the energy and time if I don't enjoy it or find it useful, from when I was young 'til this day), and had lots of friends. After that though," we started having English as a ""real"" subject", (which didn't work out for me until maybe 14/15, where I went from lowest to among the highest grades)," and I ""noticed"" that I didn't really have any friends. Well", I had friends to hang out with in school, but I guess that's where my Fi went in and said that that wasn't enough," and I wanted ""more"" than just that. So during the latter half of elementary school", I went through without having any real friends. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Later (13/14", but relevant as I started developing my Te more here (I think)), I used to get in to a lot of fights with my mom, and looking at it from now, I see that it's mostly Te/Fe. (also just teenager/parent, but influenced by the functions) As I always wanted things to make sense, and she didn't give me a reason for things but still forced them upon me, it simply created friction. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I haven't had any problems with other kids in my age that I can think of. And Te wasn't that obvious either. Probably since I was raised in a very non-Te way by my ENFP dad and ESFJ mom. I was always taking the more submissive part in relations I entered", which I didn't always like, but that's how I worked at that time, so that's what I did. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When I was between five and about 12", most of my spare time was spent outside, making swords of sticks and wood and bow and arrow, and then playing with those in a made-up world. Sometimes, I could even stop playing for half an hour or so, just to think of the back-story of who I was, the world around him, etc. I've always enjoyed making things myself, and have a couple of padded swords I made just half a year ago," for more ""realistic"" fighting. So I guess that interest has always been there", more or less. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Another thing I loved was Lego", and making things myself (not according to the design, but how I wanted it to be).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Another thing that might be of interest is that when I became old enough to start helping with cleaning the house and stuff", I pretty fast came to the conclusion that I had to have the responsibility for some part of it," as it didn't work when my parents said ""do this"," do that"". ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I think I was less typical Te than I am now", though it was there, hidden underneath. I just wasn't comfortable to expose it until I changed school (elementary school wasn't that good, and people weren't accepting of Te at all...),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I usually had heaps of new ideas as a kid and I also liked to show them to other people. I managed to get many introverts very excited when they were playing with me. Being alone was also fine for me", though. I always did some crazy things like creating my own vending machine that gives out marbles (as far as I remember, I got several things stuck in the radiator when doing this) and I mixed together every kind of soap and shampoo that I found," hoping that something cool would happen. I was also really energetic and happy at that time. My great-grandpa once told my grandma: ""This kid isn't able to walk normally."" She asked why he thought that and he responded: ""She takes two steps and every third one is a jump"" I remember that I was always very interested in science and my dad teached me how electricity works and gave me plugboards with all sorts of stuff to experiment with. I also had a book about it but I usually just tried my own stuff. (I also had a chemistry set and I tried to grow crystals for some time)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I hated my kindergarden because the people were boring and never let me do what I wanted. The girls weren't very nice although I had a few female friends and I just liked to play with some of the boys. Also", I frequently threw tantrums at that age because I was indecisive and someone forced me to decide. During elementary school, I had two very good friends and also got along with the rest of the class. Our school was a bit alternative and we were able to do whatever we wanted whenever we wanted as long as we finished everything until the end of the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I was at an after-school care club for one year and I totally hated it because of the same reasons", I hated kindergarden. I usually just played with an ENTJ girl who was pretty bossy and sometimes hard to cope with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The start of middle school wasn't hard for me in terms of school work but there was one girl that heavily bullied another girl. I was in a rather introverted phase but I still decided to call her out for it - I don't even know why... Then", that girl also tried to make me look bad which was just... kind of irritating but I didn't really care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	My parents got divorced when I was 13 or something and it really hurt me", although I didn't show it. For almost a year, I sucessfully hid it, just because I didn't want pity from anyone. In addition to that, my ENFJ mum wanted to make everything more structured and started to give me restrictions.(I was able to decide almost everything on my own before that and it worked) I fought a lot with her and I often got into even worse situations because it's hard to discuss with someone who isn't willing to listen to other opinions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	How I handle life", could you develop that question? I'm pretty sure it's an interesting one, I just don't see what you want from the question yet.     Using emotions means to use them as tools to get things done. Using anger for ambition, sadness for determination, happiness for caring. Its a fuel for actions basically and not a show stopper. It also means using an emotion to get a job done. So if im feeling sad or upset and I need to do something, I will think of something that will make me angry or upset or happy in order to get the job done. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Hmmm so you dont really see how emotions connect with one another in a network and the complexity of it? Like how a daughter can dislike and love their mother? Im curious as to how this is difficult for you.....O.o Is it like Te with me? O.o",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	LOL", in a way it is. But this one more so focuses on controlling the emotion than using it as fuel. So like using fire to power something, but making sure it does not get out of control. The fourth is about control of the emotions and not utilizing it as a tool. So regulating your emotions and others even negative ones. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	What are you studying? Also", do you like higher education structure so far?    I have no idea what I'm studying. All I know is not theater or art or anything like that. I want to learn programming and get a math minor, but other than that, everything is wide open, because I honestly have no idea what I'm doing lol ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I actually do. I was really homesick when I got here and wasn't sure how I'd like the huge emphasis on tests", but I love the lack of busy work. I've been able to study before the day before for once in my life- and have actually had to, because there's so much information. I'm not as much a fan of the lecture only classes, and much prefer the discussions, but the material is really interesting. I have a good Spanish teacher too, which is especially nice because my high school teachers really didn't teach me anything. Overall, I spend a lot less time in class and a lot less time doing actual work, so as long as I make sure not to become a recluse, it works for me. I spend a lot of time in the common room so I can both be productive and get actual human contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ					LOL", in a way it is. But this one more so focuses on controlling the emotion than using it as fuel. So like using fire to power something, but making sure it does not get out of control. The fourth is about control of the emotions and not utilizing it as a tool. So regulating your emotions and others even negative ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	It can be difficult for me to ignore things like hunger. Even if I try to ignore it", the sensation is powerful and tends to be very distracting. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	That said", I am the first person to ignore pains if they're not serious and I have something on my plate that I care more about.

If I have to pick a specific situation it'd be a few times pretty recently when I'm just spending time talking to my closest friend.    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Why would that be the case?    Well INFJs tend to be more observant and open to who people", similar to INFPs. Difference is that they have a different method and way of understanding others. They have Fe as a second function so first they want to know all about who you are and piece the info together from what you tell them and what they observe. Then they will say what they agree or disagree with all while respecting you and not pushing you do things you are not in agreement with or are uncomfortable with; exploring you and their limits. My best friend is an INFJ and although my views with hers arent in alignment (as in how i should function and behave), she understands that my way and function isnt wrong but different and vice versa. We share the same or msot of the same values. I value independence, creativity, personal space, expressing emotions, and expressing opinions. What we disagree on is consideration of people, patience, chances and even listening. She merely says, well i dont agree with that i see it this way because I believe this, and im like okay; interesting. I mean she does say, i think you should do this because so and so to which im like no, i dont agree and shes like ok; she accepts it. If she gets cheeky and does the whole i say one thing when i mean another I do tell her to knock it off but its only sometimes. What im getting at is that INFJs tend to let you be you without pushing anything they think on you usually; and just let you be you while trying to understand you more; similar to INFPs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	No not type descriptions. I am basing it on keirsey", Isabel Myers writings and research from articles. I find socionics to be too confusing and it doesn't match up with Keirsey or MBTI so i don't reference or use it. Keirsey and MBTI connect with one another and branch from one another so its easier to follow and make connections. Keirsey states NFs have a definite goal, and its the search of identity; which is blatantly true. We all search for who we are and what our purpose is and that's our MAIN goal or should I say focus in life. Its our number one worry, who am I? Who am I really? Where do i fit in this world? What is my calling? I am who I am, never change me. If i lose who I am, then there is not point in living. Its always on our minds. I am not saying its the only type who thinks this, merely saying that's all that matters to NFs. Along with identity its how can i make peace in this world? Harmony, beauty, art, creativity, avante garde; that's our drive. I am speaking in general for this whole post btw. Now the differing methods comes from the functions, which in turn goes to approaches. For example, when meeting a total stranger, if I find the person is setting off alarms then i act cold and distant to the person; even before meeting them. My INFJ friend however will pick up the same vibes but with Fe, will be polite and kind so not as to hurt their feelings; despite the alarms she is feeling. Me, I don't care and that's where she will be bothered and then I get upset that she still acted like she did despite feeling something was off; because to me that's not being true to her feelings which greatly bothers me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	But as I said", I don't have much experience with xNFJs.    I think you may have and don't know it. They will be the most understanding and gentle in your life. But i guess if you havent then you havent.  Yeah i was thinking the extroversion and judging. Outgoing and organizing. Hmmmm how different is it? Like an example? I mean are you open to trying different and new methods of working? NFJs tend to push you to do better in your own way or improve you, as that is their focus and function. Its why they are called Counselors and Teachers. Thing is, sometimes they don't know when to stop pushing and that can be very irritating..... I find diplomacy is the key thing in NFs. Keirsey sees the NFJs as the mentors and the NFPs as the advocates; which makes sense and you just told me that Fi users tend to bring out the best in you. So NFJs are like, let me guide you to be a better you, let me help you improve and grow; let me guide you, and NFPs are, you are awesome just as you are, go for what you want and ideals and never forget to keep learning and growing. is this what you mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	 In terms of function.....its relatable to keirsey in like you can explain HOW NFJs are the teachers and counselors and HOW NFPs are the champions and healers. Not the other way around.

"ESTJ	I am still not getting your point here. I already told you where you can find the whys and hows.

"ESTJ	Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go via the parents seeing that she values their opinion strongly and want to do things 'the right way'.

Maybe she feels she let her parents down and herself as it went too fast. I'm not saying you should propose", but rather somehow make contact with them in some way that makes her feel more at ease with the situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	From what I can see with my dad", stress causes him to get very creative in pessimistic thinking: everything will be interpreted in the worst possible way. For example, our family bought lately, even though second hand, a very expensive vehicle. My brother arranged most of the deal and purchase, but was quite surprised when he paid a part in advance and learned that there was still an extra amount VAT to be paid. He concluded that he had misunderstood the dealer, especially when thinking afterwards of what the man had said. My father on the other hand (who had never talked with or seen the man), felt that the seller was trying to deceive us. When later on there seemed to be a problem with the brakes (because it had stood too long still), this idea was enforced and he was angry with my brother for not being more firm enough towards the seller. However, my brother who had made the contact with the dealer knew enough to trust the man and indeed, in the end, the seller paid for all the extra repairs without too much fuss. I'm not saying it's wrong to be cautious, but for my dad the worst possible interpretation was the reality and he was upset towards others for not seeing this. I'm sure not all ESTJ's are this way and I should add that he is also chronicly ill and therefore more prone to stress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Enlighten me please :)    So... I'm an ENFP and I totally approve of what he said (I'd like to finetune his advice", but I'll skip that for now). Perceived success (having a relationship with someone you pursued) is not always the same as actual success (being with someone who's nuts about you, chases you around, can't believe he won you and touches you every opportunity he gets). Many women will say," ""I asked the guy out and it worked out fine"," but they won't tell you about the things that aren't working in the relationship because they'd be arguing against their point  However, some rare women can pull off pursuing men and kudos to them! 
ESTJ	You're of course free to do what you want 
ESTJ	TL;DR: you can pursue a guy and have a reasonable relationship. To have a fantastic relationship where he can't believe his luck, it is better to choose from the men who pursue you.
ESTJ	Edit: but obviously, you'd only pick someone if you like them. Not just because they pursued you.

ESTJ	Interesting. I don't think it's either. Probably a person thing. I have a younger sister, and if she'd ask this kind of question, I would answer the opposite. I've never understood why guys always should initiate contact, and I'd appreciate if a girl interested in me made the first move. Just seems like a tradition based in nothing, which became the norm.    He may just be driving me nuts then.....-___- I hate doing this dumb process of calling and then having to look....super annoying. How are you guys good at this stuff? O.o
ESTJ	Originally Posted by Scarlet.Black   How does your Fi effect your life? :)    My dad is an ESTJ and he goes through relationships the same way I go through sensory stimuli when I'm stressed, and he can be extremely sensitive about his values when I challenge them extensively (as in pulling out the corner stone and tearing down every counter argument, in an attempt to see where it'll take us) with logic.

Constantly challenging someones view or value is extremely draining and unnecessary in our eyes. With Fi included, this can make us.......not be around you. We dont mind a challenge, constantly doing it is going over the line though. With inferior Fi, it can be hard to express this while someone like INFP or ISFP will express this immediately and just.......drop you. Values are not something to be logically explained; it just is and whoever doesnt like it has to deal with it. We can only explain why we value it, nothing more, nothing less. Ex: I value babies. Why? because they are cute, intelligent, full of potential, interesting, strong, adorable, and loving. When you love them, they give love in return and you know its genuine and your love will be returned. Thats it. That being said, goodluck trying to get an INFP, ISFP to share their values lol.
ESTJ	Originally Posted by gritglossandrainbows   So... I'm an ENFP and I totally approve of what he said (I'd like to finetune his advice, but I'll skip that for now). Perceived success (having a relationship with someone you pursued) is not always the same as actual success (being with someone who's nuts about you, chases you around, can't believe he won you and touches you every opportunity he gets). Many women will say, I asked the guy out and it worked out fine"," but they won't tell you about the things that aren't working in the relationship because they'd be arguing against their point  However, some rare women can pull off pursuing men and kudos to them! 
ESTJ	TL;DR: you can pursue a guy and have a reasonable relationship. To have a fantastic relationship where he can't believe his luck, it is better to choose from the men who pursue you.
ESTJ	Edit: but obviously, you'd only pick someone if you like them. Not just because they pursued you.    This.
ESTJ	I actually have the same thought deep down but to get this reaffirmed by someone else only makes it more convincing..
ESTJ	But to talk about my past experiences, maybe I failed a lot because I didn't show any sign reciprocation, so it's honestly hard to listen to what he had to say.
ESTJ	I don't know much about types but maybe it won't work with an intj >_<      Originally Posted by Pinina   Interesting. I don't think it's either. Probably a person thing.

Just seems like a tradition based in nothing, which became the norm.    Hmm.. I think this is what my brother is thinking as well. I bet he likes it too when a girl made the first move but he isn't saying this to me. Maybe he just thinks that if a guy really likes a girl, he will pursue her. That's what I catch from him.
ESTJ	I talked to him before asking about this guy and that guy and what should I do. He mostly answered just let them come to me, don't be too eager or what.. Hahaha so you would advice the opposite to your younger sister?

ESTJ	But yea, pretty much. I use it to show that you're stupid"," now shut up"".

I would say we would be one of the most reliable types to stay in a long distance relationship.

"ESTJ	Restlessness - This usually happens when I'm stuck in a group setting or having to converse with people that I cannot find common ground with (Ex: differing tastes in music that I have no idea about)-- it doesn't challenge me logically/intellectually so I become really restless. I just kind of let it be-- I allow myself just to be bored if I can't leave the situation or find someone else to converse with.

"ESTJ	I have been dating an ESTJ guy for a couple of times. He recently has divorced because of his wife betrayal as he told me. However", I don't know the story in detail. Actually I would like to know more but he asked me to give some time and then he will explain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Well", as an ENFJ this was a little bit difficult relationship for me, actually too harsh ;) but he showed a lot of enthusiasm and I also liked him and had feelings for him so I continued. Then one day we had a heated up conversation on a topic he brought up which I felt insulted and reacted strictly and somehow emotionally that hurt him. To me it was not hurting. If he could have put himself in my shoes, he would have told me far worse! Anyway... a few hours later I apologized for making him upset. He responded nicely but again sent me a video which I found again disturbing. That brought the next round of fight but this time in a passive way! He called me and I did not respond as I was really mad of him. Next day I asked him to meet and resolve the issue but this time he said it would be better to give time and meet later. Meantime he had a trip to visit his family and when he came back again there was no sign of him. I told myself I will text him for the last time and if he does not reply I will let it go. This time he replied with delay but we met and resolved most of the issues that bothered both of us. In the end he told me that he would have liked to continue this relationship but right now he is looking for a new job position which is not sure yet. Also while visiting his parents, he had visited a psychologist who advised him to take a few more months of break as it is too early after his divorce to enter a new relationship. He highlighted the job issue for his reason but I personally think that the advice of the psychologist was more important to him as he said I don't want to make a mistake again. Finally he asked me to give him 4-5 month time to make things work. After that we were in contact 2-3 times for just doing some normal favors for each other. Now it has been over 5.5 month and there is no sign from him. I really am not the type of a person who starts the relationship, so I don't want to call him and ask him about his status. I am just wondering that shall I assume it is over? was he some kind of polite at the time he was explaining his situation? I am really confused... ESTJs please help me in understanding him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	When an ESTJ is upset", to they want to be comforted, left alone, or to just vent? (Or something else?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by November Rose   When an ESTJ is upset", to they want to be comforted, left alone, or to just vent? (Or something else?)     When an ESTJ is upset they generally try to compensate such by regaining or controlling their surroundings, often ignoring or repressing the internal issue itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Though this is rather a type 8 response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Type 3 ESTJs will most likely do the same but to control/regain their image or success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by November Rose   When an ESTJ is upset", to they want to be comforted, left alone, or to just vent? (Or something else?)     Depends on the kind of upset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I am hurt", I want to be left alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I'm angry", I'm going to very vocal about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I'm bewildered and in disbelief", I'm going to vent to a friend in private.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by November Rose   When an ESTJ is upset", to they want to be comforted, left alone, or to just vent? (Or something else?)     I like to be comforted but ONLY if I'm upset in front of someone I like/love (or want some attention from - any closer friend). But generally I like attention, so... if we're friends, I'd like to see that you care by comforting me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I'm upset in front of someone who's not close to me", I'd probably appreciate their efforts to comfort me, will get pissed off at their efforts to distract me with fun activities or to leave me alone, and still I'd wish that they left me alone cause 'it's none of their business'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Having control", as someone mentioned above, is mandatory. I mean... I (and probably 'we' - ESTJs) have complete and utter control even when we're upset. Maybe the other ESTJs react differently, I can't say, but even if I'm very upset, I'll get myself together quickly and remember who reacted how and did what (in reaction to my being upset) as information which I'll use somehow in the future. I gather information, A LOT of detailed information about anything I care about... and use it later. Manipulation? Maybe. Strategic thinking? Probably. ESTJ trait? I guess so...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Only someone I like/love can hurt me", and if I'm upset because of them, the person can fix it by comforting me, showing me that they care, paying attention to me. Others can do anything in the range of 'nothing' to 'annoy me'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If I'm angry at something", short-term mutual venting will do and any person I'm angry at would better stay away from me as I may be really disrespectful, to the point where I don't feel it right (remember - we love the rule book).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   1. What kind of traditions do you like to follow (if any)? I know us SJ's are stereotyped as being conservative and traditional", but I feel for me It's more of what I grew up with than what society considered traditional. is it the same for you? Do you have family traditions?    I follow no traditions. That tradition-following image probably comes from the lack of being too spontaneous (and I mean 'too', because we are spontaneous sometimes). I don't conform much, not even on Christmas, Easter and other traditional holidays. Family traditions? WTF is that? Seriously, if it's something like going fishing every other Sunday of the month, I'd rather hate to do it - I don't like to HAVE-TO-DO anything. So... no ESTJs are the same, I guess.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   2. Do you consider yourself a private person?    Depends on what you mean when you say private. I'm private in terms of my important plans, and emotions which may change a result/goal I'm going after. I'm manipulative, so I'm private about what my true intentions are. For the sake of 'whatever-it-is' I can be really open, but it will be fake, and all I tell you will serve me some purpose. Of course, I can be honestly open (rarely, cause I don't really need to, I deal with my shit alone) but I'll never tell you something which you can effectively use against me... ever. (most people are not like that, so that could be not coming from the ESTJ personality, that could be just me specifically),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	The only way you can make me be open", truthful, etc. with you is if you are more intelligent than I am and you've proven that you care about me a lot (by giving me more intelligent solutions to my problems) - that is if you want to make an ESTJ open up. Again - that could be just me.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   3. What's your biggest pet peeve in other people?    I can't stand stupid. Unintelligent. Too emotional. Especially, too emotional + stupid = get TF away from me. I also can't stand people who let other people walk all over them, people who don't stand up for themselves, weak, feeble, whatever... people who only follow and never lead. All else is negotiable but being an idiot in that way towards yourself and your life is what puts me off the most in other people.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   4.

I am but I don't really care about large groups and one-on-one is often more fun because it's more meaningful. Also, you can manipulate better one-on-one. Large groups are fun. One-on-one has some point. And I, personally, prefer it to have some point. Most extroverts probably like large groups because they haven't got a hidden agenda like I do. Introverts prefer one-on-one because they don't like large groups and whatever. My reasoning - I'll use either the one-on-one or the large group to my benefit. I like large groups, though, for fun.      Originally Posted by Aspiringwriter   5. I'm ISTJ- could our types get along? I've never met any before and am curious about the dynamics.    I usually prefer extroverted people but if intelligent enough, an introvert will catch my attention. However, I can't stand people with no social skills, or people who avoid others. I don't like it when you don't communicate at all with the shop assistants or waiters, or if you can't talk to strangers (for whatever reason) because of being shy or avoiding people in general. I value social skills and I like anyone who's got better ones than mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	He also had a habit of putting too much responsibility on his employees.

"ESTJ	My grandfather is an ESTJ", and a very intelligent and learned one at that. However, I often find that disagreements (about e.g. environmental policy) cause us to have very heated discussions that lead nowhere. I find his Te-Si to be inflexible and unimaginative in such discussions - when I want to explore opportunities for improving the status quo, he'll shoot them down without even properly considering them in the bigger picture (in my opinion, anyway). He will also use his age and life experience as arguments in a discussion. These things can be really frustrating to me, but it also makes me wonder: how do you other ESTJs perceive Ti-users (perhaps particularly Ti-Ne) in discussions and debates?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	She's generally really nice to her friends", but not very nice to people she doesn't know well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	This is a very naive comment as I have only ever met one ESTJ and it is her", and I haven't done any research on this MBTI personality. I understand that one person does not represent a whole entire MBTI personality, and I truly hope I haven't offended anyone by my questions and comments.    The ESTJ you're describing sounds very immature, especially if she can't control her emotions. However, I can repeat a lot of things that I hear as I make everyday conversations but if it was a sensitive topic that was shared to me or someone specifically asked it to be kept a secret, I would not share that information. ESTJs can be very trustworthy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	 In my experience ENTJ is more one track minded and is like a bulldozer in terms of themselves and their goals", and a bit more actually domineering than ESTJ. (Although ESTJ can seem that way they are slightly more flexible to having others make decisions having Ne. Similarly to how an ESFJ is. It's really one of the big differences in Ne vs Ni.) I think it's easier to see the Fi of ESTJ since they have Si.. Making them a bit sentimental. ENTJs would probably perceive ESTJs as a bit softer than they are. (Not that they're soft, but I mean compared to ENTJ everyone is lol!),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I think ESTJ humor tends to be a bit lighter", maybe a bit childish and pun filled (like the rest of the Deltas) and ENTJ tends to be more cutting and edgy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His job was different and he was worried that he wouldn't learn the new skills adequately. I told him that he's top in his field for a reason and his ability to learn things on his feet is amazing.I gave him examples and I told him that not only did he learn the skills he needed", but he did so at a rate that got him promoted very quickly.

"ESTJ	I gotta catch you while your here since there's only a few of you", and even less females    I haven't dated an INFP, but I think my problems with my ex were not based on extroversion but rather the xNFP vs XSTJ differences. It was a great relationship in the beginning with the whole opposites attract idea but the differences were just too much as we became more serious. Our biggest issues came from the fact that I am very goal oriented and driven and I started to see him as more of a dreamer than a doer. It led to lots of fights where he thought I was bossy and I thought he wasn't practical and too emotional. Not saying it can't work if two people are really dedicated and willing to put in the effort, but we realized that we saw the world differently and wanted different things in life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	ESTJs", why do you probe people on their insecurities? Especially in a group setting. Is it a lack of awareness? Is it the shear curiosity that you can't restrain? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I notice this pretty frequently", and in fact find it to be a very strong trait in ESTJs  (in maintaining accountability in others), because I can tell it's usually not intended to humiliate the person being probed, but more for the ESTJ to find the truth. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	- Would you dress in blue jeans and a surfer-type t-shirt in the corporate world? He dresses so casual in a leadership position and it confuses me.    1. No opinion.

"ESTJ	2. Absolutely not in a corporate setting", especially if no one else dresses that way. If I were to do casual, I would make sure it was still fashionable/put together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally Posted by Coburn   Absolutely not in a corporate setting, especially if no one else dresses that way. If I were to do casual, I would make sure it was still fashionable/put together.    The thing is, the people in the teams below him (aka he is the boss of these various teams) do dress casual, with jeans and piercings and nerdy tshirts. The reason is: they are teams for marketing, graphic design, etc, so they are nerds and artsy people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	However", the boss's job is not artsy, he manages the projects and the teams. Also, his secretary/assistant dresses like you would expect a corporate person to dress. It's super weird to see them walk around together (she is his shadow, at his beck and call) because it's watching a nerd-looking guy followed by a hot victoria's secret model dressed in a suit, having meetings with sales people.

"ESTJ	ENTJ's", after my Fe cloak wears out, will call me on my questionable lifestyle (I like to think it's because they care about me) and will actually change their whole attitude towards me until they see me changing and giving results. For example, I was very hesitant about going to college. An ENTJ I really respect was borderline upset with me for doing that and explained to me the importance of a certificate and how I should worry more about my future since my other alternatives didn't sound very good to him (you know," the typical ""my entrepreneurship will make me rich"" 18-year-old kinda thinking). I actually considered his point of view since he rationally explained it to me and made me think. The principles behind his", and many other's arguments linger in the back of my head when I make a decision, and it's come to be something useful. If we are both mature, my relationship with one will usually be cool at first, then kinda weird and awkward, then useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	When an ESTJ and I meet", we usually shake hands. Then I say something or do something they will immediately ridicule me for. Then I try to apologize for it since I don't feel like arguing.

Then I get this itchy feeling on my back, the kind that signals me I need to get out of a situation ASAP. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	This is not always the case", of course.

It always completely confuses me because for someone who is so task and detailed oriented who generally remembers such weirdly specific details she'll completely forget something you've told her multiple times in the span of ten minutes. For me", even if I haven't rememberd a specific event I can picture myself understanding how that event would have come to be if someone mentions to me that I have forgot something (Ne) and I can move forward with intuition fixing whatever problem has come; my ESTJ manager will just compeletly forget and not just forget but vehemently deny such a thing ever being said/happening. I honestly don't know how to navigate this behavior she has. I've noticed this behavior in a few ESTJs and it perplexes me. I would assume for someone so logically consistent and detail oriented that these things wouldnt fly over an ESTJs head as much as it does?      Originally Posted by ANAXEL   As an ESTJ," do you ever find Ne irritating? Have you ever seen it in action and liked it?    Ne in ESTJs particularly of the slightly more relaxed version is super obvious. Especially in a more casual enviorment; you can see it in ESTJ ""story-time"" where an ESTJ will start going on random Si/Ne tangents; ESTJs can often have a really great sense of humor and be quite funny and enjoy creativity (you don't see it as much in ESTJ work mode). I have known some ESTJs to venture into art and creative projects. I think (bad) Ne grips in ESTJs make ESTJs seem *super* paranoid. Never fun to be in the presence of an ESTJ in a non-functioning Te-Ne loop - although it's kind of hilarious. My ESTJ manager will become just completely and utterly scatterbrained", paranoid by every possibility, messy (A lot of ESTJs are really messy and have like a sort of organized chaos I don't think cleanliness is actually a strength of a lot of ESTJs.) it's like she looses all sight of organizational skills. She will have papers and stuff everywhere, a mess that she made then complain that she can't work in an enviorment like that (but she doesn't even think to clean it up lol). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Every ESTJ I've known has hated my Ne (initially); but also loved it. I remember when I started working with my ESTJ manager she would tell people ""man this girl asks a lot of questions"". She would complain about it initially and I knew she didn't love the amount of questions I asked but at the end of day because of all my questions I would do everything right and cover all my bases (exactly why I do this). I look at every possibility and every situation from different angles so if a situatuon did come up I can react when that situation did come up. Eventually she was using me as example to other staff because I wasn't afraid to ask questions. And because of my questions I was doing everything right. ESTJs only find Ne annoying if there's no follow-through as long as you can prove your competence and it takes a long time for ESTJs to trust anyone so it's not overnight. Always expect some amount grumbles from an ESTJ though when you're talking to them with a lot of Ne (especially in a work enviorment). I've known many ESTJs to apologize for acting too harshly in the moment but don't expect it until later and probrably after you've proven yourself to them.

You're Te clashes with an INTJs Ti? INTJs have tert Te, do you mean INTPs? Because INTJs have tert Te. I can imagine INTJs getting along quite well with ESTJs so long as they are working towards the same goal/have the same vision and similar values. Otherwise it would not work. I suspect that INTJs will still respect ESTJs dom Te and ESTJs would respect INTJs vast intellect and forward thinking/goal setting. I know my boyfriend respects a lot of E*TJs I can only imagine him being in purposeful friendships with them however, I would suspect romantic relationships are a bit more rare. ESTJs can be a little to set in their ways for INTJs I think so relationships can be a bit harder to develop initially.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	I've known both types pretty well and this breaks down the differences pretty well.    I think we can be philosophical as well some of us more then others. some of the more academic ones or ones who are more interested in more ideas an language", grammar and things. I think saying we just reminisce isn't really that accurate. I hope we don't just do that! I think the ENTJ definitely understand philosophy as a whole much better, I tried studying that stuff and couldn't get my head all the way around it. I am going to base this off a new acquaintance of mine from talking to him for like 10 maybe 15 minutes at most. He told me he's in to existentialism and nietzsche. That stuff has no appeal to me and I don't really want to go anywhere near it. I don't know if I get it either. He studied philosophy in college I am studying for English Journalism and political Science. I have a feeling I am much more in to the pragmatic and realism. I am always going to argue for the more traditional. Political philosophy is my realm where it is not the ENTJs. He'll approach politics from the less political science side more the what will work and the existential realm. I am much more no-nonsense then he is, I can detect  it, he's is a bit more thought out in a sense and a bit more flexible. He's probably a bit more fun and easy going and less likely to tell you right out what he thinks. I don't know if he can talk about the trivial, I can talk about that kind of stuff a bit more I think and not exactly get bored. I don't talk about it like my ESFJ dad but I can sort of talk about simple stuff too, where as this guy would probably wonder off and talk I dunno music theory? he plays and teaches music.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We got along so well that I am almost certain a week before her death I was one of the last people Irene ever called. I never challenged her even though sometimes our slight differences usually small and opinion based. I would say something and Irene sort of squashed it and the discussion went no further. We sort of ganged up on her husband me the teenage ESTJ and Irene. I felt a bit sorry for Richard sometimes but Irene was right.

"ESTJ	If you wanna know something about ESTJ's emotions in general", then it's likely a thing they are most vulnerable at, completely their weakest part. In healthy manner emotional needs shouldn't be ignored by ESTJ, but rather be very personal and very unknown even to ESTJ himself. At least this is what I think. Using emotions makes me feel 'weak', it's just not my thing, but I appreciate them a lot. I surely feel them, but often don't really comprehend them completely, fail to express them, overall it's something to hide and to keep for yourself, because I wouldn't want to make a wrong step. Meanwhile dominant thinking function is complete opposite, it can be powerful, brash, outbursting and spitting logic, where it needs to. So if you think, you can read very subtle things and silent agreements, then relationship can start. I can say that after my grandpa's death, almost 5 months ago, I still haven't touched emotional conversations topic. Not because I don't feel anything, but because becoming vulnerable freaks me out. Similar to being naked in public. And the thing is that I probably felt the biggest emotional impact out of all of those people, but I never told that to anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ			   I guess you are talking about this", but i would like to know what ESTJs think of other people's sensitivities. This seems to me that you are talking about your own emotions.

I can't seem to explain her that my emotions are in my way, she tries to understand me i can see that, but it also seems like something so unfamiliar to her. So i'm actually wondering how you guys perceive it, like what is really going on inside your head when you encounter smb like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So i'm actually wondering how you guys perceive it, like what is really going on inside your head when you encounter smb like that.    I believe I can help. With less self-aware ESTJ's, inferior Fi suppresses their own feeling based judgments and so they tend to consider that the same in others is also a weakness. It's a projection. They have spent their lives suppressing their feeling based judgements and that has given them success so it becomes a self-repeating cycle of suppression > validation - which then again gets projected to others because they had success with it. Emotions while not Jungian related in terms of psychology similarly also got repressed because repression for them reaps rewards over time ... Then comes the nature of Si where it's mostly projection of what worked for them would work for others - and since repression of emotion worked for them," it'll work for someone else too. Most (if not all) ESTJ's don't have the time or the energy or even desire to understand emotions of others at all because they're so busy repressing all of that F related ""stuff"" in their own mind. They need to be repressed because if they're not repressed then they get in the way of achieving what they wanted to achieve. My dad is a lot like your mom in that regard. Only after turning 73 has he started somewhat exploring his emotional side", but even then he'll share a few emotional things one day and then go back to his repressive state the next like nothing ever happened. Right now one of my cousins is dying of a stroke (he's only 51) and my dad has no emotion to speak of. None at all. It's clear that he's buried it so deep that it seems like it doesn't even exist - and he probably believes that it doesn't exist for him either. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it depends more on upbringing, culture, past of that person. It's something like you don't expect thug to understand that, but you expect your psychologist to understand. Imagine similar thing mixed up and spreaded everywhere. Many people would be something in the middle. ESTJs in particular have it a bit different. Likely you see them dealing with their weakness. Some will deal, some not. In your example ESTJ (yet I would doubt that) somewhat tries to start up rusty Fi, but way superior Te just drives over it, completely takes over control. I personally would listen to what other's tell me about their emotions, but stuff gets complicated when there's a choice of Fi and Te. Te is default," ""at home"" way", Fi is something person needs to put more effort for it to work," comparable to ""being with guests"," you never knew before"". It's probably the most what could be told", because jungian typology isn't a set in stone bible for people's behaviour.

"ESTJ			   Firstly", I'm sorry for your loss. If I may offer a perspective on how...or rather who...to go about sharing your emotions to. This is my completely uneducated analysis of the cognitive functions at play ...What you're after is someone to understand how you'e feeling about your loss (satisfies Fi) and approve and validate it completely (satisfies Te). I believe this is the source of the vulnerability for ExTJs, especially since they can't always understand let alone explain the depth of their pain. If the Te approval is not met, it will severely hurt your Fi. Ti-Fe works in the reverse, to understand a concept (Ti) and for the collective to decide on how to feel about it (Fe). With Fe...the verbal etiquette surrounding death can sometimes feel hollow, and some people are dismissive and don't understand others' grieving process. And that's why it's important to have someone in your life that you trust completely, even if just one or two people. What that trustworthiness looks like is that even if they don't immediately understand what you're going through, they will believe you when you say you're hurting very deeply and ask questions if necessary. You want to find someone who takes an interest in your life and asks a lot of questions about you. Understanding is really the key to feeling comforted. I see ESTJs with people in their life who are just there because of what they can do for them, nothing more. But do they care to really know on a deep level who is the person who's doing all these things for them, and more importantly, how are they feeling? No.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You kept talking about Fe and magically there's a need for understanding person. Maybe to Fi Fe approach can look shallow, but yet again it depends. I felt almost nothing in church, but when I got to that house. The house those grandparents were living and I spent my childhood summers into. I couldn't handle. Memories were fresh, I saw some of his things, like clothes, glasses. It felt like he should be here, but he wasn't. That was very hard to see, I sat down on chair in the kitchen (first room after little corridor in that house). I couldn't handle that and tears started to flow. That was my weakest moment. Now I sort of remember things that he did or how he did some stuff. It's a village, so lots of things had to be done outside. Even if it's wrong to say, I will say that he was to me more of father figure than my own father. I still know more about him as person than I do about my own father. I can tell you more, but I don't think I need. You can see that Fi here isn't handicapped thing at all, only not preferred way of dealing with things. I have told whole story to one person in perC. So I had a person to which I could tell everything. I can say that what I wrote about the death and my feelings, could qualify as art. Even if Fi 4th, it can shine more than some people's 1st.

Possibly, but person can't be from my relatives. Grandma almost needs help herself due to loss, mom doesn't have a good emotional support capabilities.

You may be a bit too harsh about other people, but what you say holds some truth. Not many are willing to investigate with what person they are with. I personally dumped natural human desire to reach for success, like money, house, car... All that stuff to low level or to sensoric appreciation level only. I hold feeling at higher value. I often feel not so good, when people only care about grades, what you achieve in your life. I feel that this is wrong to ignore the wonders of other people, that have no monetary value. Many things can't be counted with paper. We do enjoy many things that affect us differently. I think I seek that. I sort of started to hate school for not focusing much on anything else, but grades. It feels disgusting that the only thing we are trying to achieve in that place is just how to score higher on some meaningless stuff. I'm a bad student. I have no attitude to just learn, but I may have entered a secret stage of learning the stuff that many others don't even think about. I sort of became a vandal. Started to vandalise some property, destroy things. Not a lot, just a bit. Totally not a great thing to do, but still even in there I can only see the same pattern. You destroy property and you are bad person," but what's lacking is some thoughts about ""bad people"". No one cares if you have problems", somewhat want to express yourself. You can be either good or bad, based on way too simplicistic logic. No one cares to investigate those works that are bad as something more neutral, worth to be investigated further. Hell, even my username should suggest something. It's my best attempt at defining me and it's The red spirit. Deep philosophy of life with unique desires. I changed my type to ESTJ some days ago, not sure if I should have done that. My previous type was ISTP. I always feel like some great things about person aren't defined by type. Those noobs, who enter MBTI world and think this is some mega cool godsent stuff are likely the worst thing to happen. Some dudes wanted to touch the depths of the people, but rarely anyone wants to investigate further. Then later some people believe it's the greatest touch of depth to ever exist. That's not true. Not true at all, but who understand that? WHO!? Almost no one.
"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Ariviel   I guess you are talking about this", but i would like to know what ESTJs think of other people's sensitivities. This seems to me that you are talking about your own emotions. The reason i am asking is, my mom is an ESTJ and whenever i try to explain a problem of mine she just can not comprehend why i don't do things in a logical manner. I can't seem to explain her that my emotions are in my way, she tries to understand me i can see that, but it also seems like something so unfamiliar to her. So i'm actually wondering how you guys perceive it, like what is really going on inside your head when you encounter smb like that.    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Originally Posted by Ariviel   Do ESTJs find emotional people weak or can they strike as cute to them too? What do you feel or what goes inside your head when you can not relate to other person's sensitivity?    Entirely depends on context. Emotion in itself is not a weakness and doesn't strike me as wrong. There are times and places where I find it admirable. But when it is used to peddle helplessness or a victim complex", or to demand something of me or others which is not duly owed, I find it ugly. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know a lot of people say ESTJ are not very affectionate and kind but I disagree with my experience with a few I know. Which bring me to my question, are ESTJ affectionate and kind to people ingeneral? If not do they just have to be close to the person?

Ok, I'm not ESTJ, but I know a number of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	Usually people say ESTJs are mean and not affectionate "," then someone comes in with an exception like ""ESTJs aren't mean and not affectionate contrary to popular belief.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	It goes back and forth. ESTJs prefer to be more professional in their approach with strangers", not mean, not too nice, just neutral. With people they are close too they can relax and show affection but it is not in ways that are obvious to people who do not know them," some forms of ESTJ affection can be making you the butt of their jokes (this is a way to draw attention to you and pick you out of a group of people to say ""Hey", I notice you, and I like you as a person," otherwise I wouldn't be taking the time to say your name let alone make a joke about you."") Super duper forms of affection are not normal for an ESTJ", they can put on a professional smile, they can be polite to strangers just fine but this does not mean much and only is done because it's how one must conduct themselves in public, or to show they were raised right. This whole professional demeanor is dropped with close friends, as they joke more say more crude things and relax. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	ESTJs also do not dislike nice people and they appreciate truly kind people", what they find uncomfortable and distrusting is huge displays of flagrant emotion," they may not know why someone is being so favorable towards them or how honest someone is being when they dole out things like ""OH MY GOD I LOVE YOUUUUU! OH MY GOD I'VE MISSED YOUUUU."" And it's not common for an ESTJ to show those forms of affection. ESTJ forms of affection come more in the form of acts of service. If an ESTJ ever shows concern in your well being or your problems", they care about you to some extent to supply their greatest strength and asset to you, their energy and their time, because ESTJs can be highly scheduled people and do not give their precious time to things that do not matter to them, because they have something more important to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	If you are seeking warm compassion", ESTJ will respond with professional and neutral responses. So you will be disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	But as far as people close to them", usually these people can range from work buddies who share their work struggles and listen to their work complaints, a stress reliever and sounding board if you will, old time friends they can reminisce with and share those that their worldview, people they can go out with and have a good time drinking a beer with, to people who can help them relax and laugh because they can playfully bring up things that are unordinary and help the ESTJ get out of a serious mind frame and be silly for a few minutes before they get back to work. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	With the ESTJs I've known I usually end up being the silly non threatening friend they at first kinda like to keep around", but then start to REALLY like to keep around lol. I've even made my ESTJ boss, who is a pretty intimidating woman, laugh by saying a silly and unusual joke. It seems like a nice treat if the silliness does not distract one from getting work done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	All the ESTJs I've known they've never been super affectionate", even one girl I knew and friends with was not super affectionate, it's more like they are enthusiastic about helping me if I have a goal or a problem," and that's an easy way to see ""Wow this person is a real friend!"" and it's easy to see they care about you through that enthusiasm. I remember one time I missed my bus and it was driving to a bus stop a mile down the street", my ESTJ friend who dropped me off at my current bus stop, saw that I missed my bus," and he pulled up to me and said ""Hey"," let's catch that bus."" Like some old time movie crime partner lol", I hopped in the car and he raced after that bus, and he didn't feel burdened or anything, he was excited to help even though it had nothing to do with him, that felt like real friendship, no affection or any of that stuff needed (also we are both guys so that's weird lol). I've also had another ESTJ friend who I let stay at my apartment for 2 months, he fixed me lunch for work everyday he stayed there LOL, without asking, and he cooked for me and my roommate, without asking, we are both guys so it was weird at first but he was happy to do it, and felt like he couldn't stay in my house without contributing something, even though nothing was required, good friend, no extra emotion or affection needed once again, and we are close. I've had another ESTJ friend pay for his own and my plane flight ticket," just because he was excited I agreed to go out of town to an event with him. That to me seems like and ESTJ being ""affectionate."" But I think with strangers they'd rather be professional", polite, neutral, or just social, but not super emotionally expressive or accommodating to people they do not know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I mean I've seen an ESTJ talk about how when his daughter started to distance herself from him when she was in her rebellious teens", he just started to bring her in closer, taking her everywhere with him and trying to keep the relationship strong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I've also seen an ESTJ cry many times in public about his wife who passed away years ago", and the way he talks about her you can tell he loved her and she was everything to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	So yea", they are people, like everybody else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	I know these are really personalized examples", so at best they just provide a bunch of exceptions to common stereotypes, but at least it shows there is no one way to be ESTJ even if thre are common trends among them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ESTJ	Do you ESTJ usually feel like you are introverts", or do you think he might be an ISTJ    I don't know what the deal is with some extroverts thinking they are introverts. I see this misunderstanding occur more than introverts thinking they might be extroverts. Maybe it's a lack of self awareness for some, I'm not sure. But some ESTJs can be very quite and not social, simply because they aren't interested in what the group is talking about, but once you talk to them about themselves or something they know, you can tell this person could have a conversation with a wall, meaning that once they get started they do not require you to speak anymore lol,<< Extrovert. My Pastor is an ESTJ and he think's he's an introvert because sometimes he likes to get alone and take a break from socializing and read a book -_-. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	What I honestly think is this", someone will read the extrovert and introvert descriptions," and an extrovert might read the E descriptions through the lens of ""this is normal behavior everybody does this."" and when they read the I description they see it through the lens of ""Oh wow I do that sometimes"," that's what that is? Wow I must be an introvert since I do like alone time sometimes."" Not realizing that their own surprise at why they might like alone time occasionally is the very thing that exposes them as an extrovert"," if alone time is something surprising or ""different"" or unusual for you", but not really necessary, you are an E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks for the answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	In my mind", I determine extroverts/introverts by asking if they get energy from being with people or being alone. Ofcourse most people are a mix and need both a social life and some alone time, if they are not to the other extreme. But you get a general idea of what the preference is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	According to my brother and his wife", he doesnt mind not socializing alot with people on his spare time... His family is enough for him (to put it in perspective, he has been married and been like this the last 8 years, so its not just a phase thing),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ESTJ	So to summarize what i have written into a single question", is a wife and two kids enough social stimulation for some ESTJ long term, or would you get bored?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
